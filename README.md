This repository contains the Quire theme built for the [V&A](https://www.vam.ac.uk/)'s
[Research Institute](https://research.vam.ac.uk/) to make available its [research 
journal](https://research.vam.ac.uk/journals/) using the [Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/) publication tool.

Additionaly, there is a style guide used to aid in the development of the components
