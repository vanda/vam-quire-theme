                    the sparsity of serious historical attention given to Jones
                    is surprising, considering his role in the history of the
                    decorative arts, design education, and the development of
                    the South Kensington Museum, the continuing success of some
                    of his designs (versions of his wallpaper designs marketed
                    in the 20th century by Laura Ashley), and continuing sales

                    For a researcher, it is a delight, but perhaps not a
                    surprise, to discover close links between objects in the
                    V&amp;A collections and the work of a figure so embedded in
                    the foundation and philosophy of the Museum. My recent
                    research has focused on the Museumâs nineteenth century
                    Indian textile collections and this article will focus on
                    apparently unobserved connections between these collections,
                    Jonesâs Grammar of Ornament, and his own designs.

                    Jones, Indian art, and the formation of the V&amp;A
                    collections
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    As a young architect, Owen Jones was profoundly influenced
                    by his travels and observations in Egypt, Turkey and Spain
                    (notably the Alhambra) in the 1830s. As Michael Snodin has
                    commented, âHis foreign experiences were to lead directly to
                    a set of architectural and design theories which combined
                    the pure romanticism of the East with a scientific approach
                    to design, ornament and colourâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    Some of these experiences were vicarious; he did not
                    actually visit India, or indeed many of the countries whose
                    art was represented in the pages of The Grammar of Ornament,
                    first published in 1856. This was not, after all, the age of
                    jet travel. Jones acknowledged in the Grammar that the
                    section on Indian Ornament drew heavily on objects shown in
                    the Exhibitions of 1851 (London) and 1855 (Paris).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    The Indian displays at these exhibitions were assembled via
                    the East India Company and an elaborate network of
                    committees and sub-committees in its four Presidencies in
                    India: Bengal, Agra, Madras and Bombay, following an
                    exhaustive classification system devised by the Exhibition
                    Commissioners in London.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    Textiles and clothing accounted for seven of the twenty-nine
                    classes of materials exhibited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In âGleanings from the Great Exhibition of 1851â, published
                    in the <em>Journal of Design</em>, Jones reflected on the
                    meretricious values of the European manufactures: âAfter
                    wandering through the halls of this most wonderful
                    assemblage of the worldâs industry, the artist who passes
                    down the nave from east to west will see on either side but
                    a fruitless struggle to produce in art novelty without
                    beauty â beauty without intelligence; all work without
                    faithâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones considered that in comparison, âThe Indian and
                    Tunisian articles were the most perfect in design of any
                    that appeared in the exhibition â¦ a boon to the whole of
                    Europeâ.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                    The Indian work in particular showed, âall the principles,
                    all the unity, all the truth, for which we had looked
                    elsewhere in vainâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    In this he echoed a broader admiration of Indian artefacts,
                    especially textiles, which had first come to the attention
                    of a mass public at the 1851 Exhibition, and to that of a
                    more limited audience at the East India Companyâs
                    Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                    Here was possible redemption from the âcarpets worked with
                    flowers whereon the foot would fear to treadâ, and other
                    horrors of contemporary industrial production.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may be useful to describe briefly the method by which
                    Indian objects were brought into the South Kensington Museum
                    following the 1851 exhibition, since Jones was critically
                    involved in this. The broader context was summarised by
                    Clive Wainwright who, although challenging the assumption
                    that 1851 purchases defined the South Kensington Museum
                    collections, admitted the key roles of Henry Cole, Richard
                    Redgrave, and Owen Jones in their formation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals, together with A.W. Pugin (whose demise
                    occurred during the process) and John Rogers Herbert, formed
                    the committee for selecting objects from the Great
                    Exhibition for the School of Design collection displayed at
                    Marlborough House that was to form a substantial core of the
                    Museum. Time was short. Wainwright has drawn attention to
                    the following entry in Coleâs Diary for 8 October 1851:
                    âRedgrave, O. Jones met and examined French and Indian
                    articles for Schools of Design.â This was done in the
                    exhibition itself, starting at seven oâclock in the morning,
                    before the admission of the public. The following dayâs
                    entry noted, âCompleted examination of Articles except
                    Indian. Too numerous in good things.â Wainwright noted that
                    nearly a quarter of the Â£5000 budget allocated by the
                    Government was eventually spent on Indian objects from the
                    exhibition, and of these Indian textiles were very well
                    represented, accounting for sixty-five out of the 139 items
                    purchased from the display.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A further Â£500 was spent the following year at the East
                    India Company auction of Indian objects that had failed to
                    sell at the exhibition, although the Times commented that:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      âThe collection comes before the public in a rather
                      depreciated state, and with its chief ornaments abstracted
                      â¦ The Queen had the best of everything contained in it.
                      The Government Commission made a careful and judicious
                      selection for its Museum of Practical Art â¦ many rare and
                      valuable contributions were merely lent for the occasion
                      of the Exhibition, and have been restored to their owners.
                      The Company, too, have not been unmindful of their public
                      duties have behaved most liberally to learned institutions
                      and to scientific menâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>

                    These remaining objects could have been bought at knockdown
                    prices, for as the Times noted, âYesterdayâs sale â¦ realized
                    â¦ Â£800, most of the things going very cheaply, and some
                    (especially the gold and silver tissues) being disposed of
                    at great sacrificeâ. The kincobs (silk fabric with patterns
                    woven in a weft thread of gold and silver- wrapped thread),

                      our greatest authorities in art manufactures have
                      concurred in pointing them out as masterpieces of taste
                      and skill, they have been bought as useless for any other
                      purpose than what they may bring in the melting

                  <p>
                    Fortunately, a substantial number of superb kincobs and
                    other woven silks remain in the V&amp;A collections and more
                    were bought in India in the early 1880s.

                    The Grammar of Ornament and the circulation of Indian art
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Although Jones trained as an architect, his surviving
                    reputation has been as a designer and decorator, a maker of
                    books and as an educator. In keeping with the utilitarian
                    and educational motives of Cole, the âThirty seven
                    Propositionsâ, or âGeneral Principalsâ set out by Jones in
                    the Grammar had as their goal the general improvement of
                    artistic standards through mass education. âNo improvement
                    can take place in the Arts of the present generation until
                    all classes, Artists, Manufacturers and the Public, are
                    better educated in Artâ, he stated.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    The underlying idea was that the principles governing the
                    use of design and ornament could be extracted and applied to
                    manufactured objects that would be readily bought by
                    similarly educated consumers. The intention of the Grammar
                    was also that examples of pattern could be extracted from
                    their context, absorbed by the viewer and appropriately
                    reworked or applied to new manufactures, although direct
                    copying was to be avoided.

                  <p>
                    Exemplary patterns were found by Jones principally in
                    non-European decorative arts. In the words of the
                    contemporary curator J.C. Robinson, âthe contribution to the
                    Exhibition of 1851 from various oriental countries were â¦
                    recognised as possessing special claims to the attention of
                    the decorative artist, and their superiority, in point of
                    design, over European stuffs, was â¦ for the first time,
                    fully admittedâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>
                    At the 1851 Exhibition, âamid the general disorder
                    everywhere apparent in the application of art to
                    manufacturesâ, Jones found that Indian artefacts stood out
                    in terms of their âunity of design â¦ skill and judgment in â¦
                    applicationâ and, âelegance and refinement in â¦
                    executionâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup></strong>
                    Jones particularly admired the âequal distribution of the
                    surface ornament over the groundâ and the use of, âthe most
                    brilliant colours perfectly harmonisedâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such themes became the leitmotif of the âgood tasteâ
                    promoted by the South Kensington authorities.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones intended the Grammar to reach as wide an audience as
                    possible, particularly in the manufacturing districts of
                    England, and, despite its cost, fifty copies of the Grammar
                    and twenty-five copies of Jonesâs Plans, Elevations,
                    Sections and Details of the Alhambra (Owen Jones and Jules
                    Goury, 1842â45) were purchased for distribution to Schools
                    of Art in 1857.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup></strong>
                    Thus details of Moorish, Indian, Chinese, Egyptian and many
                    other types of designs could be inspected beyond the
                    exhibition spaces of the capital. In addition, actual
                    objects could also be seen. The establishment of a system of
                    circulating exhibitions in the 1850s allowed for first-hand
                    examination of a wide range of objects. Thirteen of the
                    twenty-one textiles selected for circulation to museums and
                    provincial schools of art in the mid-1850s were from India.
                    Some schools also bought their own examples of Indian
                    textiles, originally shown in the 1851 Exhibition; eleven
                    pieces were bought for the Cambridge School of Art in the
                    1860s.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup></strong>

                    workâ (from the East India Company collections) and
                    âembroidered and woven fabricsâ shown in 1851 and at the
                    Paris International Exposition of 1855. The sources of
                    âHindoo Ornamentâ illustrated in Chapter Thirteen however,
                    were architectural, and largely based on museum collections
                    in London, copies of the Ajanta cave paintings, and Ram
                    Razâs History of the Architecture of the Hindus, published
                    in 1834.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup></strong>

                  <h2>The collections as source for the Grammar</h2>
                  <p>
                    During the course of recent research into the formation of
                    the V&amp;Aâs Indian textile collections, it has been
                    possible to identify a number of objects in the Asian
                    collections which can be directly related to plates in the
                    chapter on Indian Ornament in the Grammar. Although drawn by
                    Jonesâs pupils Albert Warren and Charles Aubert, and not by
                    Jones himself, the objects were selected by him both for the
                    museum collections and again for the book and deliberate
                    exposure to a wide public. This gives a strong sense of
                    historical continuity to objects in the collections and to
                    Jonesâs estimation of their aesthetic value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As already noted, a feature of Indian decorative design
                    particularly admired by Jones and his contemporaries was,
                    âthe equal distribution of the surface ornament over the
                    groundsâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup></strong>
                    An example of this is a woven silk fabric with repeating
                    flowering plant design from Aurangabad, now in Maharashtra
                    (figure 1) which was illustrated in the Grammar (figure 2).
                    It was purchased from the 1851 Exhibition for Â£4 and was
                    also illustrated in Henry Hardy Coleâs 1874 Catalogue of the
                    Indian collection at the South Kensington Museum as an
                    example of good design on account of its muted colours,
                    âflatâ design and regular repeat typical of the Mughal and
                    Deccani style used in many media including textiles.

                  <p>
                    Indian Kincob were among the most sensational and admired
                    fabrics shown in 1851 and at subsequent exhibitions. Kincob,
                    an anglicised term of uncertain origin, is a rich silk
                    fabric with patterns woven in a weft thread of gold and
                    silver-wrapped thread (zari), made by wrapping gold or
                    silver wire around a silk core (kalabuttu zari). Kincob was
                    usually sold by weight. One example (figure 3) from Benares
                    (Varanasi) has a gold ground and trellis design in silver,
                    black and red, containing a flower pattern. It was purchased
                    from the 1851 Exhibition for Â£32.10s (Â£32.50) and was
                    described as âKinkhob Jhaldarâ (Jhali or jali, trellis or
                    net) in the 1852 Inventory and was illustrated in the
                    Grammar (figure 4). The net or trellis pattern (jali) often
                    referred to as a âdiaperâ pattern, was a motif considered
                    exemplary and emulated by design reformers such as Jones and
                    William Morris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Benares (Varanasi) was, and remains, famous for its silk
                    weaving, and a number of examples from its workshops were
                    shown at the 1851 Exhibition. A sumptuous sari (figure 5 ,
                    figure 5a) woven from crimson silk and gold-wrapped thread,
                    was purchased from the 1851 Exhibition for Â£22. The
                    patterned, loose end (pallu) of this of this sari
                    incorporates flower motifs, a floral meander, chevron
                    (khajuri) and floral designs and at least three of these
                    motifs were illustrated by Jones in the Grammar (figure 6,
                    figure 7, figure 8).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A variety of regional Indian textile techniques were shown
                    in 1851, and at later exhibitions, Indian craft workers were
                    brought to Europe to demonstrate their skills to the&nbsp;
                    public. Indian embroidery was greatly admired in Britain in
                    an era when embroidery was both practiced at home and
                    promoted by the Arts and Crafts movement; a number of
                    examples were represented in the Grammar. A motif taken from
                    an embroidered Huqqa mat (figure 9), is illustrated in the
                    Grammar (figure 10) Embroidered garments from Kutch
                    (Gujurat) were purchased for the Museum from the 1851
                    exhibition, and at least two of these were illustrated in
                    the Grammar: a curious black satin garment described as an
                    âapronâ embroidered with designs of flowers and leaves
                    (figure 11, figure 12, figure 12a) and part of an unsewn
                    skirt made of yellow satin woven silk, embroidered in chain
                    stitch with silk thread&nbsp; (figure 13, figure 14).
                    Embroideries such as these were made by professional male
                    embroiderers from the Mochi (shoemaker) community in Kutch
                    for wealthy Indian patrons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other specialised techniques may have been unknown in
                    Britain. Kota, in Rajasthan, which does not have a strong
                    weaving tradition, was, and is still, famous for a fine
                    translucent cotton cloth known as malmal, which imitates the
                    more expensive gold silk brocade. The design is stamped in
                    gum onto the fabric, usually muslin. A layer of gold or
                    silver foil (either real gold or silver leaf or ground mica)
                    is laid on top and rubbed in; the residue is then thoroughly
                    beaten into the cloth so that it will resist wearing. A red
                    muslin turban from Kota, overprinted in gold (figure15) was
                    bought from the 1851 Exhibition for ten shillings (fifty
                    pence); its lattice motif was illustrated in the Grammar
                    (figure 16).
                  </p>
                  <h2>Jonesâs designs and the Indian textile collections</h2>
                  <p>
                    Besides his architectural and educational work, Jones also
                    practiced a wide range of applied design, including textiles
                    and wallpaper. The influence of Indian textiles is apparent
                    in several of Jonesâs own designs, besides names such as
                    âNizamâ, âSultanâ, âPeriâ and âMaharaneeâ â all textile
                    designs for Warner and probably named by the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones strongly discouraged the direct copying of the designs
                    displayed in the Grammar, although he thought it was
                    inevitable â a âdangerousâ and âunfortunate tendency of our
                    timeâ, since it produced designs with no cultural context or
                    meaning.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup></strong>
                    Thus we would not expect Jonesâs own designs to be mere
                    copies, making it difficult to âmatchâ them exactly with
                    their probable Indian sources. There are also problems in
                    distinguishing between the many similar and common motifs of
                    Indian textiles â used widely in other media including
                    architectural decoration â such as the trailing vine, diaper
                    or trellis, and various floral repeats, several of which
                    were drawn for the Grammar, and also in âtranslatingâ motifs
                    from woven silks and embroidery to printed and woven
                    patterns. In this respect, a woven silk from Aurangabad
                    (V&amp;A Museum no. 799-1852) can be compared with a floral
                    motif reproduced in the Grammar (âIndian No.4â, example 17)
                    and with a wallpaper designed by Jones (V&amp;A Museum no.
                    PDP 8336:106). Despite these reservations, at least two of
                    the wallpaper designs by Jones in the V&amp;A collections
                    (figure 17, figure 19) are very similar to motifs
                    illustrated in the Grammar (figure 18, figure 20). In
                    different media, at least two of the silks designed by Jones
                    for Warner in the V&amp;Aâs Textiles collections are very
                    close in design to Indian textiles bought from the 1851
                    Exhibition. Despite Jonesâs strictures about copying,
                    âMaharaneeâ (figure 21) is almost identical to one of the
                    motifs embroidered on a large silk canopy from Multan
                    (figure 22). And, despite its apparently Greek name, the
                    scrolling leaf and flower motifs in Jonesâs âAthensâ woven
                    satin furnishing fabric for Warner, 1870â74 (figure 23)
                    closely resemble those found in Indian woven silks such as
                    the woven silk and gold-wrapped thread sari (figurev24) and
                    the related example illustrated in the Grammar (figure 25).
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                  <p>
                    While comparisons such as these can become a self-serving
                    exercise, the identification of Owen Jonesâs primary source
                    material in the V&amp;Aâs Indian textile collections has
                    some value. It provides specific evidence of the high
                    aesthetic esteem placed on Indian artefacts, specifically
                    textiles, by the founders of the Museum and the accompanying
                    nationwide programme of art education. It permits a clearer
                    understanding of the meaning of the principles of good
                    design formed by Jones and his colleagues, and in the case
                    of Jones particularly, how these could be translated into
                    manufactured designs. It also highlights the limitations of
                    translating objects into two-dimensional images, however
                    fine the quality of printing in the case of the Grammar of
                    Ornament. For the textile pieces illustrated were
                    three-dimensional objects, with the texture and
                    (highly-valued) irregularities of the hand-made.
                    Furthermore, most of them were made to be worn, to move with
                    the human body, and to be seen in very different climatic
                    conditions and contexts from those of darkest, gas-lit
                    Victorian England. Seeing these objects next to their
                    âmechanical reproductionâ may bring some of these
                    differences into relief.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the global migration of design motifs, these
                    examples provide a very specific illustration of the way in
                    which traditional patterns of Asian textiles could be
                    mediated through a network of taste arbiters to reach an
                    exhibition in South Kensington, the pages of a ground
                    breaking design manual, and the domestic design productions
                    of nineteenth-century manufacturers of furnishing textiles
                    and wallpaper.

                    Owen Jonesâs Grammar of Ornament has been an influential
                    design manual for more than 150 years, yet its material
                    sources have not been properly examined. Newly observed
                    connections between the âIndian Ornamentâ illustrated in the
                    Grammar and textiles in the V&amp;A collections, selected by
                    Jones and his colleagues, may enable better understanding of
                    Jonesâs aesthetic principles, and the sources of his own
                    design work.

                          âSouth Asianâ clothing textiles in âBritishâ culture
                          in both colonial (1850s to 1880s) and post-colonial
                          (1980s to 2000s) times. Research in the V&amp;A is
                          investigating three sets of acquisitions made between
                          1852 and 1883: purchases from the 1851 Great
                          Exhibition; John Forbes Watsonâs Collections of the
                          Textile Manufactures of India (First Series 1866,
                          Second Series 1873â77); and the textiles sent back to
                          South Kensington from India by Caspar Purdon Clarke
                          during his 1881â82 trip to buy objects for the
                          Museumâs Indian collections.
