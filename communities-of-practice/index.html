                  <h2>1&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
                  <p>
                    The V&amp;A identifies its audience in terms of six
                    definitions of visitor type, which are not mutually
                    exclusive. They are: independent adults, students, families,
                    organised groups, schools and adults from the Creative
                    Industries (CI). Whilst the V&amp;A has a long association,
                    dating back to its foundation, of working with artists and
                    craftspeople, it is only within the last decade that this
                    latter group of visitors has been grouped together under a
                    particular label. Developing an agreed definition of the CI
                    as part of the visitor segmentation post-opening of the
                    British Galleries in 2001 had been somewhat of a struggle,
                    but by 2004 the Museum had a set of six audience
                    definitions, including one for the CI. However, this was an
                    ‘internal’ definition, so to speak, and during the last
                    decade the nature of the CI has become something debated far
                    wider than within the V&amp;A as an institution. The
                    introduction of the term ‘creative industries’ in government
                    language in the late 1990s was the beginning of an attempt
                    to bring unity to a fragmented selection of industries
                    identified as contributing significantly to the British
                    economy. Since then, there have been significant
                    developments in policy aimed at nurturing, benefiting from,
                    and ensuring the continued growth and success of, the
                    Creative Industries. Responsibility for this sector lies
                    nominally within the Department of Culture, Media and Sport
                    (DCMS), but both the Department for Skills and Education
                    (DfES)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    have launched initiatives and commissioned reports
                    investigating the growth of the creative industries sector.
                    The Cox Report, a review of creativity and design in UK
                    business, was published in December 2005.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    One of the objectives set out in the V&amp;A’s 2007–2012
                    Strategic Plan is, ‘to promote, support and develop the UK
                    creative economy by inspiring designers and makers and by
                    stimulating enjoyment and appreciation of design’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response to this, and as part of a long-term programme to
                    revisit the definitions of its six visitor categories, in
                    2006 the Head of Gallery Interpretation, Evaluation and
                    Resources at the V&amp;A launched a research project aiming
                    to redefine the V&amp;A’s audience segmentation description
                    of the CI. After an initial literature review was conducted,
                    data was collected over the course of nine months and
                    consisted of three phases:

                    The findings from this research project were extensive and
                    complex. This short article will present one aspect only of
                    the findings, which is an exploration of the appropriateness
                    or otherwise of considering the CI in terms of a community
                    of practice. Within the terms of the research, it was
                    necessary to establish this before going on to consider the
                    findings in terms of the nature of the relationship between
                    the CI and the V&amp;A. These latter findings will be
                    presented in a further paper to be submitted to the V&amp;A
                    journal at a future date.
                  </p>
                  <h2>2&nbsp;Defining the Creative Industries</h2>
                  <p>
                    It was first necessary to identify current definitions for
                    the CI in a wider context external to the Museum. The
                    literature review looked at government publications and
                    reports related to the CI, and explored a number of agencies
                    and forums that have been set up to service the CI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were several findings with direct implications for
                    V&amp;A thinking about CI visitors. The first was that they
                    include those not actually involved in a creative occupation
                    themselves (e.g. an accountant at a design agency) and those
                    involved in a creative occupation but not actually working
                    in a creative industry (e.g. an in-house designer working
                    for a city firm). This type of definition dates back to
                    early thinking about the CI, such as the 1998 report
                    ‘Creative Britain’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second finding was the inclusion, by agencies such as
                    the Creative Industries Task Force,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    of industries where creative processes are utilised.
                    Therefore the CI in their broadest spectrum are considered
                    to consist not just of’core’ industries with obvious
                    creative output but also industries employing ‘creative
                    strategies’. These are termed ‘related’ industries and
                    activities and are included in all government strategies for
                    the CI. These first two findings can be said to form a
                    spectrum of ‘creative activity’ ranging across a variety of
                    type and depth of engagement with creative practice in
                    people’s work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The third significant finding was that, despite much
                    discussion about the potential educational and social
                    benefits to be gained from nurturing the CI in the UK,
                    ultimately economic benefit to the UK is the primary outcome
                    Government Departments responsible for CI initiatives are
                    interested in, as emphasised in the 2006 report by the
                    Entrepreneurship and Skills Task Group (ESTG).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, and in notable contrast, it was found that that
                    many elements within the CI sector do not necessarily label
                    themselves as such. The literature review looked at current
                    magazines and journals associated with sectors identified
                    under CI, such as “Blueprint”, “Crafts”, “Design History
                    Newsletter” and “Frieze”, and found that there was little or
                    no reference to the CI. It also is worth noting that the
                    Office of National Statistics, in a recent publication of
                    figures of the UK workforce segmented by industry, does not
                    have a separate segment for the Creative Industries.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The broad ‘creative activity spectrum’ identified has
                    attendant issues for anyone interested in working with the
                    CI, and particularly for this research project, because of
                    the enormous variation of scope and activity within the unit
                    of study. This makes it a challenging sector in terms of
                    visitor profiling for the V&amp;A.
                  </p>
                  <h2>3&nbsp;Communities of Practice</h2>
                  <p>
                    Given the issues in defining the CI, the researchers used
                    Wenger and Lave’s ‘Communities of Practice’ methodology as a
                    framework to define the research.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                    ‘Communities of Practice’ is grounded in sociological theory
                    of practical knowledge, and pedagogical theories of situated
                    and social learning. It aims to identify groups of people
                    bound together through knowledge, and is based on a
                    definition of knowledge that includes tacit knowledge that
                    is shared informally through human interaction processes
                    such as storytelling, conversation and coaching or
                    mentoring. Their greatest value lies in intangible outcomes,
                    such as the relationships they build among people, the sense
                    of belonging they create, the spirit of inquiry they
                    generate, and the professional confidence and identity they
                    confer to their members.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, ‘Communities of Practice’ also acknowledges that
                    this shared knowledge is dynamic: constantly changed,
                    transformed and updated through these same processes.
                    Members spend little time on searching for solutions to
                    short-term problems because they can get access to help or
                    immediate solutions quickly through their community or
                    communities. Members are also more likely to take risks as
                    they feel they have back up and support from the community
                    of practice. This has the intangible outcome of a sense of
                    trust, which in turn has a tangible outcome of an increased
                    ability to innovate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are three indicators of structure for a community of
                    practice:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      A domain of knowledge with a defined set of issues, which
                      creates common ground and a sense of common identity. The
                      domain also inspires contribution and participation.
                      However, it requires participants to know its boundaries,
                      in order for members to be able to present ideas and
                      pursue common activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A community that creates a social context for learning.
                      The community interacts and fosters relationships based on
                      respect and trust. An effective community of practice
                      handles dissent productively. Members are able to share
                      ideas, expose ignorance and ask difficult questions. This
                      interaction fosters learning and also a sense of belonging
                      and commitment. However, members remain individual not
                      homogenous, and develop their own specialities and styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A practice consisting of a framework of shared ideas,
                      tools, information, language, stories and documents. This
                      forms the basic knowledge of the community that all
                      members share and from which development and innovation
                      can spring.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>

                    found to be consistent within the CI:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>design challenge</strong>: pushing boundaries
                      in all areas of practice, e.g. working with new materials
                      such as casting glass in microwaves, ‘using new
                      technologies and integrating them into the craft process’
                      (Jeweller).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>business environment</strong>: participants
                      made very clear choices about assuring at least a base
                      level of income. This was perhaps not their ideal
                      practice, but freed them in their other time to follow
                      their own practice, as ‘the idea really is that we can say
                      no to jobs that we don’t want to do rather than just
                      having to take everything on’ (Architect); the practical
                      motivation for this work did not mean they would
                      compromise on quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Validation through
                      <strong>peer and commercial success</strong>. Participants
                      were very concerned about making the right product for the
                      right audience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Validation through <strong>‘client’ feedback</strong>.
                      This was particularly so at the initiator end of the
                      spectrum, as for example an auction house director felt
                      ‘well we are seeing it from the sales but we get good
                      feedback, we have had excellent feedback from things but
                      the great thing about (x) is that you can see whether
                      something is working, you can get a good feel for if
                      something’s working from the results of the sales’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Personal ambition</strong>: the need to constantly
                      push further. The jeweller disciplined herself to do one
                      collection per year&nbsp;during the summer to ‘prove to the
                      outside world that I can still do it’ (Jeweller).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Risk taking and innovation</strong>: a key
                      motivation and widely recognised indicator of creativity
                      across the spectrum, which encouraged innovation because
                      ‘you don’t hit brick walls because probably our sheer
                      audacity is doing something that people haven’t thought of
                      doing before’ (Publisher).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Enjoying <strong>problem solving</strong>, rather than
                      seeing problems as blocks to success. A jeweller highly
                      enjoyed and valued this, saying ‘it comes very naturally
                      to me, problem solving on the spot’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For a majority of makers, but significantly less so for
                      initiators, an <strong>academic research</strong> element
                      and formal education was integral to the domain. A
                      textiles designer particularly emphasised that ‘for me
                      educating is the consequence of the experience as a
                      designer and I think that if I stop designing … I’m not
                      saying that I won’t have stuff to give, but in a way that
                      was the process for how I came to education … I think it’s
                      a two-way flow and I think that has to keep going, if
                      you’re going to be effective’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Quality control</strong>: performed informally
                      through peer-review and self-discipline.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The above are issues that work well as a shared domain
                    within the communities of practice framework, and during the
                    data collection, particularly in-depth interviews,
                    participants themselves also identified some of these
                    indicators as shared across different creative disciplines.
                    A publisher articulated this as being creative skill rather
                    than specifically discipline-related: ‘if you have the
                    medium then you apply that medium, that skill to whatever
                    you are supposed to be creating but the creation process I
                    think is equal across the board in the creative world’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This research found that nature of the CI domain, as
                    identified through the indicators described above, makes
                    this community of practice more than a set of relationships
                    and goes some way to giving it an agreed identity. This
                    identity fosters commitment to care for the domain, and
                    makes the CI a community of practice, more than a collection
                    of individuals with an informal communication network.
                    However, it was fragile and there was constant flux within
                    this domain. For some participants this was a source of
                    anxiety as well as challenge, because ‘it’s an industry that
                    changes constantly, it’s very easy to fall behind and not be
                    aware of current activities that are part of the working
                    environment’ (Textiles designer).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looking at the nature of the ‘community’ within the CI, this
                    research found that the network was primarily how people
                    across the entire spectrum tried out new
                    <strong>ideas</strong>, and tested them. A publisher
                    described ‘you know everybody comes up with bad ideas but
                    luckily there is a good filtering process. The more people
                    you talk to, you can weed all those out before they get any
                    further and cost a lot in development’. Within the
                    community, creativity itself was described predominantly in
                    terms of a <strong>process</strong>, that ‘creativity is the
                    thought process needed to produce or provide’ an identified
                    outcome (Jeweller). Notably, at the maker end of the
                    spectrum, people defined themselves as academics and had
                    planned to do so, as a jeweller recalled: ‘I had applied
                    also already for the RCA because I wanted to become a
                    teacher really, that was always my plan’. This was part of a
                    desire to pass on skills and intangible knowledge gathered
                    during <strong>experience</strong>, not just in terms of
                    creative skills but also business skills, considered vital:
                    ‘I wanted to feed that back, to channel it back in to
                    younger people to fast-track their experiences in a lot of
                    ways through the experience that I’d had and transmitting
                    those to someone, so that they didn’t have to go through the
                    same experience to an extent. That they could accumulate
                    that, based on someone else’s experience, that had gone
                    before’ (Textiles designer).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often, the aim of working in the CI was a vocation the
                    participant was aware of from an early age, for example a
                    theatre director who said ‘I have a feeling that I have been
                    working towards it all my life’. Surprisingly, being
                    creative was actually seen as only a small part of the
                    criteria for professional success. However, it was the
                    kernel that made all the difference to their enjoyment of
                    work, as ‘it’s the idea to go back and be able to talk about
                    ideas and spend hours in a whole day talking to people about
                    ideas and process and values and that’s a great luxury’
                    (Architect). It is this luxury that allowed participants to
                    <strong>innovate</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mentors played an important role, even during relatively
                    unfocussed times of early professional development. This
                    ranged from sensing a feeling of empathy with like-minded
                    people, to meeting someone particularly inspiring and
                    nurturing. A publisher described: ‘I was picked up by a
                    brilliant Dutch designer from Pentagram. He liked my
                    attitude, I think it was very similar to his and really he
                    gave me an apprenticeship which I am so grateful for’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, <strong>collaboration</strong> with others was
                    critical as a way of participants finding their path in the
                    community. Across the data, people described themselves as
                    part of a chain within which they maintained their
                    individual aspect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The community factor within a community of practice should
                    be essentially a network of relationships that allows
                    exchange of ideas and risk-taking within a safe,
                    non-judgemental environment. The network of relationships in
                    the CI found amongst participants was based on five common
                    elements:
                    <strong>ideas, process, experience, innovation, and
                      collaboration</strong>. This gives confidence to its members. Members are able to
                    take risks and expose themselves to failure because there is
                    no ‘hierarchy’ within the community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research found that the community network is well
                    established within individual disciplines, but less so
                    across the whole Creative Activity Spectrum. The shared
                    issues identified above are not specific enough to coalesce
                    to form a domain that works across differing disciplines
                    within the community. The lack of these defined boundaries,
                    affecting the community network, is possibly an issue that
                    contributes to a lack of self-identification of the CI with
                    the UK Government concept of CI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Practice’, the third indicator of a community of practice,
                    was important for the CI across the spectrum. It was the
                    area where the research identified the most unifying
                    factors, for example the huge proportion of participants who
                    read The&nbsp;Guardian (82.9% of on-line participants). Within
                    practice, the notion of a spectrum of process and practice
                    came through strongly. However, it was also where the most
                    complex debate around the nature of creativity itself
                    occurred. Many participants spent a long time in discussion
                    through the various data collection methods considering
                    creativity, but one jeweller summarised the open-ended
                    nature of the debate by saying ‘creativity is easy to
                    assume, but not so to define. The concept is wide open
                    depending on its context and it would be unwise to be so
                    reductive’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An issue that came up many times was the importance not just
                    of design and practical skills, but also of understanding
                    how to negotiate the field. The need to ‘understand the
                    professional, the profession and your role within the
                    profession’ (Textiles designer) was critical to people’s
                    sense of professional identity. A significant skill was the
                    ability to see a concept through to production, requiring
                    project management and people skills. Being able to foster
                    and maintain an original concept through this was seen to be
                    the ultimate in definitions of creativity. ‘For it [the
                    final output] to resemble what you had in mind in the first
                    place is another great leap’ (Architect).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was reflected in the workplaces that were visited as
                    part of the ethnographic data collection. For the most part
                    open plan, sometimes with specific work areas allocated to
                    tasks rather than specific people, all were extremely well
                    organised and had areas where the ‘bones’ of projects being
                    worked on were exposed. For example, the textiles designer
                    was very clear about separation between what he called ‘the
                    workplace’, which is the commercial production environment
                    for textiles, and the ‘educational environment’ which is for
                    teaching, even though physically there may not have been a
                    difference to the untutored eye. All participants talked
                    about cycles of working practice they had developed to
                    ensure multiple project management. An auction house
                    Director described himself almost as the eye of the storm:
                    ‘My job is to make sure that it all comes together in a
                    timely fashion and I also work to pull the images together
                    so I can let all these people know, certainly from the
                    creative side of things’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants felt that their chosen area of design was a
                    matter of application rather than vocation, although working
                    generally in the CI field was a vocation. A ceramicist
                    described herself as a visual artist who predominantly works
                    in clay; a textiles designer had started off training as a
                    ceramicist. This was not just a matter of the type of output
                    but applying creativity across a whole range of skills, as a
                    theatre director described: ‘certainly I would advocate that
                    now people are much more, you know you’re not trained just
                    to be an actress, just to be this, just to be that, and that
                    there is something creative entrepreneur, cultural
                    entrepreneur, a real subject … you have a much broader view
                    of what you could do’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants were not necessarily specifically formally
                    trained but nearly all mentioned informal continuing
                    development (90.8% of on-line participants). Notably, at the
                    maker end of the creative activity spectrum, participants
                    had been engaging with their creative practice from a very
                    early age. By the time they were ‘mid-career’ professionals
                    they could easily have been working in various creative
                    disciplines for twenty-five years. This meant that students
                    were already viewed as professionals even by their tutors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Collaboration in the community was about working as an
                    individual within a collective, with ‘like-minded people’
                    rather than in the same discipline. The need to retain
                    individuality was directly related to professional ego, as a
                    textiles designer described: ‘I’m happy to work like that in
                    my own design field and then go out and discuss but actually
                    the design process is a quite personal one’. However, in
                    contrast to feelings about collaboration, ambition and
                    self-promotion came through strongly in terms of
                    self-discipline. This combination of seemingly conflicting
                    factors resulted in a key indicator of the CI community of
                    practice, which was that all the participants were very
                    adept at analysing their own strengths and weaknesses and
                    using collaboration to address them. They were therefore
                    good at finding people with the right skills and knowledge
                    to help them achieve the ‘vision’ of their practice. A
                    publisher described using his network for this: ‘I like
                    people who come up and can be incredibly resourceful, can
                    realise something while still being really resourceful and
                    that is why I like to employ people with a lot of contacts
                    who have worked in and around the creative field’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It seemed that the primary shared feature of practice was
                    the interest in process rather than product. Whilst people
                    were interested in following their own practice, and
                    organised their work commercially to enable that, they also
                    liked competitions, which they felt set boundaries that
                    challenged their practice and therefore produced better
                    work.

                  <h2>5&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    This research showed that the Creative Industries closely
                    resemble a community of practice. A notion of a spectrum of
                    creative activity from initiators to makers emerged, and
                    elements within the domain, community and practice varied
                    slightly according to where participants sat on the
                    spectrum. Across the whole spectrum, but noticeably with
                    makers, the idea of creative industry was seen as something
                    applicable across many disciplines. There was very strong
                    self-identification for makers from an early age, which was
                    not necessarily related to the stage of formal training they
                    may have participated in. This was in part because
                    creativity was seen much more as a process than a product,
                    but also because people were very aware of their own
                    strengths and weaknesses, and viewed collaboration as key to
                    addressing them. This was balanced with an awareness of
                    their own individual skill and unique selling points.
                    Informal recommendation and word of mouth led to the most
                    successful collaboration. Contrary to a generalised view of
                    people who are ‘creative’, commercial success was more
                    important than commonly assumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The creative activity spectrum identified in the research
                    can be thought of as relating to the intellectual property
                    of creative process, as well as to creative production.
                    Significantly, the former can happen without a notably
                    ‘creative’ output, but with a notably creative outcome,
                    which is what the DCMS was particularly interested in
                    cultivating to encourage economic success.
                  </p>

                    According to Wenger, the most successful communities of
                    practice thrive where the goals and needs of an organisation
                    intersect with the passions and aspirations of participants.
                    If the domain of a community fails to inspire its members,
                    the community will flounder.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                    However, in this case the domain of shared issues was the
                    weakest of the three indicators. The community was strong
                    but with fuzzy boundaries, and the practice was most
                    defined. For the V&amp;A, this means that it is extremely
                    challenging to nurture a relationship between the CI and the
                    Museum which both contributes to V&amp;A objectives and
                    could also be proven to contribute to Government objectives.
                    Furthermore, and most challenging for the V&amp;A, is the
                    great difference between Government thinking about the CI
                    and thinking within those industries themselves. However,
                    the benefits of the V&amp;A considering the CI as a
                    community of practice is in the potential the Museum could
                    have to contribute not only to the knowledge management of
                    the CI, the domain, but also to the practice that applies to
                    this knowledge management.
