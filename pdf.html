                    <strong>Welcome to the launch issue of the V&amp;A’s annual
                      Online Research Journal. Designed to complement the
                      longstanding V&amp;A Conservation Journal, this new
                      initiative offers a lively forum for the discussion and
                      publication of research undertaken in connection with all
                      aspects of the Museum’s activities.</strong>

                    The contents are as diverse as the scope of the V&amp;A’s
                    holdings and include in-depth articles on current research
                    policy and practices, on the historical and archival work
                    that underpins major Exhibition planning, and on the rich
                    content of our archives. Focused object-in-context pieces
                    present studies of particular collections and artefacts; and
                    an interview with a maker explores the inspirational uses
                    made of the Museum by artists and designers. I hope you’ll
                    agree that they all provide informative insights into the
                    work of our curators, educators and fellows.

                    The benefits of an on-line format mean that we can
                    incorporate feedback on individual pieces and suggestions
                    for further articles and sections in a proactive and open
                    manner. Inclusion is not restricted to V&amp;A staff, and
                    provided that submissions meet the standards set by our
                    Editorial team and peer reviewers we welcome articles for
                    future issues on the history of art, architecture and design
                    relating to the V&amp;A’s collections, public programme or
                    institutional history; features focusing on new acquisitions
                    or objects linked to V&amp;A exhibitions; reflections on the
                    educational or creative industries role of the Museum and

                    'Grand Polychromatist-plenipotentiary’ and perpetrator of
                    bad taste,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn1" id="page-owen-jones-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    and, ‘the most learned man, perhaps in all Europe, in
                    Eastern decoration’;<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn2" id="page-owen-jones-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    Owen Jones gained both notoriety and fame in his day. Yet
                    the sparsity of serious historical attention given to Jones
                    is surprising, considering his role in the history of the
                    decorative arts, design education, and the development of
                    the South Kensington Museum, the continuing success of some
                    of his designs (versions of his wallpaper designs marketed
                    in the 20th century by Laura Ashley), and continuing sales
                    of The Grammar of Ornament.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn3" id="page-owen-jones-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>

                    bicentenary of Jones’s birth in 2009 will hopefully start to
                    redress this absence.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn4" id="page-owen-jones-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>

                    For a researcher, it is a delight, but perhaps not a
                    surprise, to discover close links between objects in the
                    V&amp;A collections and the work of a figure so embedded in
                    the foundation and philosophy of the Museum. My recent
                    research has focused on the Museum’s nineteenth century
                    Indian textile collections and this article will focus on
                    apparently unobserved connections between these collections,
                    Jones’s Grammar of Ornament, and his own designs.

                    Jones, Indian art, and the formation of the V&amp;A
                    collections
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    As a young architect, Owen Jones was profoundly influenced
                    by his travels and observations in Egypt, Turkey and Spain
                    (notably the Alhambra) in the 1830s. As Michael Snodin has
                    commented, ‘His foreign experiences were to lead directly to
                    a set of architectural and design theories which combined
                    the pure romanticism of the East with a scientific approach
                    to design, ornament and colour’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn5" id="page-owen-jones-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    Some of these experiences were vicarious; he did not
                    actually visit India, or indeed many of the countries whose
                    art was represented in the pages of The Grammar of Ornament,
                    first published in 1856. This was not, after all, the age of
                    jet travel. Jones acknowledged in the Grammar that the
                    section on Indian Ornament drew heavily on objects shown in
                    the Exhibitions of 1851 (London) and 1855 (Paris).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn6" id="page-owen-jones-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    The Indian displays at these exhibitions were assembled via
                    the East India Company and an elaborate network of
                    committees and sub-committees in its four Presidencies in
                    India: Bengal, Agra, Madras and Bombay, following an
                    exhaustive classification system devised by the Exhibition
                    Commissioners in London.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn7" id="page-owen-jones-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    Textiles and clothing accounted for seven of the twenty-nine
                    classes of materials exhibited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In ‘Gleanings from the Great Exhibition of 1851’, published
                    in the <em>Journal of Design</em>, Jones reflected on the
                    meretricious values of the European manufactures: ‘After
                    wandering through the halls of this most wonderful
                    assemblage of the world’s industry, the artist who passes
                    down the nave from east to west will see on either side but
                    a fruitless struggle to produce in art novelty without
                    beauty – beauty without intelligence; all work without
                    faith’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn8" id="page-owen-jones-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones considered that in comparison, ‘The Indian and
                    Tunisian articles were the most perfect in design of any
                    that appeared in the exhibition … a boon to the whole of
                    Europe’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn9" id="page-owen-jones-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                    The Indian work in particular showed, ‘all the principles,
                    all the unity, all the truth, for which we had looked
                    elsewhere in vain’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn10" id="page-owen-jones-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    In this he echoed a broader admiration of Indian artefacts,
                    especially textiles, which had first come to the attention
                    of a mass public at the 1851 Exhibition, and to that of a
                    more limited audience at the East India Company’s
                    Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn11" id="page-owen-jones-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                    Here was possible redemption from the ‘carpets worked with
                    flowers whereon the foot would fear to tread’, and other
                    horrors of contemporary industrial production.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn12" id="page-owen-jones-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may be useful to describe briefly the method by which
                    Indian objects were brought into the South Kensington Museum
                    following the 1851 exhibition, since Jones was critically
                    involved in this. The broader context was summarised by
                    Clive Wainwright who, although challenging the assumption
                    that 1851 purchases defined the South Kensington Museum
                    collections, admitted the key roles of Henry Cole, Richard
                    Redgrave, and Owen Jones in their formation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn13" id="page-owen-jones-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals, together with A.W. Pugin (whose demise
                    occurred during the process) and John Rogers Herbert, formed
                    the committee for selecting objects from the Great
                    Exhibition for the School of Design collection displayed at
                    Marlborough House that was to form a substantial core of the
                    Museum. Time was short. Wainwright has drawn attention to
                    the following entry in Cole’s Diary for 8 October 1851:
                    ‘Redgrave, O. Jones met and examined French and Indian
                    articles for Schools of Design.’ This was done in the
                    exhibition itself, starting at seven o’clock in the morning,
                    before the admission of the public. The following day’s
                    entry noted, ‘Completed examination of Articles except
                    Indian. Too numerous in good things.’ Wainwright noted that
                    nearly a quarter of the £5000 budget allocated by the
                    Government was eventually spent on Indian objects from the
                    exhibition, and of these Indian textiles were very well
                    represented, accounting for sixty-five out of the 139 items
                    purchased from the display.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A further £500 was spent the following year at the East
                    India Company auction of Indian objects that had failed to
                    sell at the exhibition, although the Times commented that:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      ‘The collection comes before the public in a rather
                      depreciated state, and with its chief ornaments abstracted
                      … The Queen had the best of everything contained in it.
                      The Government Commission made a careful and judicious
                      selection for its Museum of Practical Art … many rare and
                      valuable contributions were merely lent for the occasion
                      of the Exhibition, and have been restored to their owners.
                      The Company, too, have not been unmindful of their public
                      duties have behaved most liberally to learned institutions
                      and to scientific men’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn14" id="page-owen-jones-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    These remaining objects could have been bought at knockdown
                    prices, for as the Times noted, ‘Yesterday’s sale … realized
                    … £800, most of the things going very cheaply, and some
                    (especially the gold and silver tissues) being disposed of
                    at great sacrifice’. The kincobs (silk fabric with patterns
                    woven in a weft thread of gold and silver- wrapped thread),
                    which had been so greatly admired,
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      … fared ill under the rude test of the auctioneer’s
                      hammer, the prices they fetched [were] based upon the
                      amount of precious metal used in the decoration. Though
                      our greatest authorities in art manufactures have
                      concurred in pointing them out as masterpieces of taste
                      and skill, they have been bought as useless for any other
                      purpose than what they may bring in the melting
                      pot.'.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn15" id="page-owen-jones-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    Fortunately, a substantial number of superb kincobs and
                    other woven silks remain in the V&amp;A collections and more
                    were bought in India in the early 1880s.

                    Although Jones trained as an architect, his surviving
                    reputation has been as a designer and decorator, a maker of
                    books and as an educator. In keeping with the utilitarian
                    and educational motives of Cole, the ‘Thirty seven
                    Propositions’, or ‘General Principals’ set out by Jones in
                    the Grammar had as their goal the general improvement of
                    artistic standards through mass education. ‘No improvement

                    better educated in Art’, he stated.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn16" id="page-owen-jones-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    The underlying idea was that the principles governing the
                    use of design and ornament could be extracted and applied to
                    manufactured objects that would be readily bought by
                    similarly educated consumers. The intention of the Grammar
                    was also that examples of pattern could be extracted from
                    their context, absorbed by the viewer and appropriately
                    reworked or applied to new manufactures, although direct
                    copying was to be avoided.

                    Exemplary patterns were found by Jones principally in
                    non-European decorative arts. In the words of the
                    contemporary curator J.C. Robinson, ‘the contribution to the
                    Exhibition of 1851 from various oriental countries were …
                    recognised as possessing special claims to the attention of
                    the decorative artist, and their superiority, in point of
                    design, over European stuffs, was … for the first time,
                    fully admitted’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn17" id="page-owen-jones-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>
                    At the 1851 Exhibition, ‘amid the general disorder
                    everywhere apparent in the application of art to
                    manufactures’, Jones found that Indian artefacts stood out
                    in terms of their ‘unity of design … skill and judgment in …
                    application’ and, ‘elegance and refinement in …
                    execution’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn18" id="page-owen-jones-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup></strong>
                    Jones particularly admired the ‘equal distribution of the
                    surface ornament over the ground’ and the use of, ‘the most
                    brilliant colours perfectly harmonised’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn19" id="page-owen-jones-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such themes became the leitmotif of the ‘good taste’
                    promoted by the South Kensington authorities.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn20" id="page-owen-jones-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones intended the Grammar to reach as wide an audience as
                    possible, particularly in the manufacturing districts of
                    England, and, despite its cost, fifty copies of the Grammar
                    and twenty-five copies of Jones’s Plans, Elevations,
                    Sections and Details of the Alhambra (Owen Jones and Jules
                    Goury, 1842–45) were purchased for distribution to Schools
                    of Art in 1857.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn21" id="page-owen-jones-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup></strong>
                    Thus details of Moorish, Indian, Chinese, Egyptian and many
                    other types of designs could be inspected beyond the
                    exhibition spaces of the capital. In addition, actual
                    objects could also be seen. The establishment of a system of
                    circulating exhibitions in the 1850s allowed for first-hand
                    examination of a wide range of objects. Thirteen of the
                    twenty-one textiles selected for circulation to museums and
                    provincial schools of art in the mid-1850s were from India.
                    Some schools also bought their own examples of Indian
                    textiles, originally shown in the 1851 Exhibition; eleven
                    pieces were bought for the Cambridge School of Art in the
                    1860s.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn22" id="page-owen-jones-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup></strong>

                    The plates depicting ‘Indian Ornament’ in the Grammar were
                    taken from ‘works in metal’, ‘specimens of painted lacquer
                    work’ (from the East India Company collections) and
                    ‘embroidered and woven fabrics’ shown in 1851 and at the
                    Paris International Exposition of 1855. The sources of
                    ‘Hindoo Ornament’ illustrated in Chapter Thirteen however,
                    were architectural, and largely based on museum collections
                    in London, copies of the Ajanta cave paintings, and Ram
                    Raz’s History of the Architecture of the Hindus, published
                    in 1834.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn23" id="page-owen-jones-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup></strong>

                  <h2>The collections as source for the Grammar</h2>
                  <p>
                    During the course of recent research into the formation of
                    the V&amp;A’s Indian textile collections, it has been
                    possible to identify a number of objects in the Asian
                    collections which can be directly related to plates in the
                    chapter on Indian Ornament in the Grammar. Although drawn by
                    Jones’s pupils Albert Warren and Charles Aubert, and not by
                    Jones himself, the objects were selected by him both for the
                    museum collections and again for the book and deliberate
                    exposure to a wide public. This gives a strong sense of
                    historical continuity to objects in the collections and to
                    Jones’s estimation of their aesthetic value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As already noted, a feature of Indian decorative design
                    particularly admired by Jones and his contemporaries was,
                    ‘the equal distribution of the surface ornament over the
                    grounds’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn24" id="page-owen-jones-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup></strong>
                    An example of this is a woven silk fabric with repeating
                    flowering plant design from Aurangabad, now in Maharashtra
                    (figure 1) which was illustrated in the Grammar (figure 2).
                    It was purchased from the 1851 Exhibition for £4 and was
                    also illustrated in Henry Hardy Cole’s 1874 Catalogue of the
                    Indian collection at the South Kensington Museum as an
                    example of good design on account of its muted colours,
                    ‘flat’ design and regular repeat typical of the Mughal and
                    Deccani style used in many media including textiles.

                    Indian Kincob were among the most sensational and admired
                    fabrics shown in 1851 and at subsequent exhibitions. Kincob,
                    an anglicised term of uncertain origin, is a rich silk
                    fabric with patterns woven in a weft thread of gold and
                    silver-wrapped thread (zari), made by wrapping gold or
                    silver wire around a silk core (kalabuttu zari). Kincob was
                    usually sold by weight. One example (figure 3) from Benares
                    (Varanasi) has a gold ground and trellis design in silver,
                    black and red, containing a flower pattern. It was purchased
                    from the 1851 Exhibition for £32.10s (£32.50) and was
                    described as ‘Kinkhob Jhaldar’ (Jhali or jali, trellis or
                    net) in the 1852 Inventory and was illustrated in the
                    Grammar (figure 4). The net or trellis pattern (jali) often
                    referred to as a ‘diaper’ pattern, was a motif considered
                    exemplary and emulated by design reformers such as Jones and
                    William Morris.

                  <p>
                    Benares (Varanasi) was, and remains, famous for its silk
                    weaving, and a number of examples from its workshops were
                    shown at the 1851 Exhibition. A sumptuous sari (figure 5 ,
                    figure 5a) woven from crimson silk and gold-wrapped thread,
                    was purchased from the 1851 Exhibition for £22. The
                    patterned, loose end (pallu) of this of this sari
                    incorporates flower motifs, a floral meander, chevron
                    (khajuri) and floral designs and at least three of these
                    motifs were illustrated by Jones in the Grammar (figure 6,
                    figure 7, figure 8).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A variety of regional Indian textile techniques were shown
                    in 1851, and at later exhibitions, Indian craft workers were
                    brought to Europe to demonstrate their skills to the&nbsp;
                    public. Indian embroidery was greatly admired in Britain in
                    an era when embroidery was both practiced at home and
                    promoted by the Arts and Crafts movement; a number of
                    examples were represented in the Grammar. A motif taken from
                    an embroidered Huqqa mat (figure 9), is illustrated in the
                    Grammar (figure 10) Embroidered garments from Kutch
                    (Gujurat) were purchased for the Museum from the 1851
                    exhibition, and at least two of these were illustrated in
                    the Grammar: a curious black satin garment described as an
                    ‘apron’ embroidered with designs of flowers and leaves
                    (figure 11, figure 12, figure 12a) and part of an unsewn
                    skirt made of yellow satin woven silk, embroidered in chain
                    stitch with silk thread&nbsp; (figure 13, figure 14).
                    Embroideries such as these were made by professional male
                    embroiderers from the Mochi (shoemaker) community in Kutch
                    for wealthy Indian patrons.

                    Other specialised techniques may have been unknown in
                    Britain. Kota, in Rajasthan, which does not have a strong
                    weaving tradition, was, and is still, famous for a fine
                    translucent cotton cloth known as malmal, which imitates the
                    more expensive gold silk brocade. The design is stamped in
                    gum onto the fabric, usually muslin. A layer of gold or
                    silver foil (either real gold or silver leaf or ground mica)
                    is laid on top and rubbed in; the residue is then thoroughly
                    beaten into the cloth so that it will resist wearing. A red
                    muslin turban from Kota, overprinted in gold (figure15) was
                    bought from the 1851 Exhibition for ten shillings (fifty
                    pence); its lattice motif was illustrated in the Grammar
                    (figure 16).
                  </p>
                  <h2>Jones’s designs and the Indian textile collections</h2>
                  <p>
                    Besides his architectural and educational work, Jones also
                    practiced a wide range of applied design, including textiles
                    and wallpaper. The influence of Indian textiles is apparent
                    in several of Jones’s own designs, besides names such as
                    ‘Nizam’, ‘Sultan’, ‘Peri’ and ‘Maharanee’ – all textile
                    designs for Warner and probably named by the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jones strongly discouraged the direct copying of the designs
                    displayed in the Grammar, although he thought it was
                    inevitable – a ‘dangerous’ and ‘unfortunate tendency of our
                    time’, since it produced designs with no cultural context or
                    meaning.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-owen-jones-fn25" id="page-owen-jones-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup></strong>
                    Thus we would not expect Jones’s own designs to be mere
                    copies, making it difficult to ‘match’ them exactly with
                    their probable Indian sources. There are also problems in
                    distinguishing between the many similar and common motifs of
                    Indian textiles – used widely in other media including
                    architectural decoration – such as the trailing vine, diaper
                    or trellis, and various floral repeats, several of which
                    were drawn for the Grammar, and also in ‘translating’ motifs
                    from woven silks and embroidery to printed and woven
                    patterns. In this respect, a woven silk from Aurangabad
                    (V&amp;A Museum no. 799-1852) can be compared with a floral
                    motif reproduced in the Grammar (‘Indian No.4’, example 17)
                    and with a wallpaper designed by Jones (V&amp;A Museum no.
                    PDP 8336:106). Despite these reservations, at least two of
                    the wallpaper designs by Jones in the V&amp;A collections
                    (figure 17, figure 19) are very similar to motifs
                    illustrated in the Grammar (figure 18, figure 20). In
                    different media, at least two of the silks designed by Jones
                    for Warner in the V&amp;A’s Textiles collections are very
                    close in design to Indian textiles bought from the 1851
                    Exhibition. Despite Jones’s strictures about copying,
                    ‘Maharanee’ (figure 21) is almost identical to one of the
                    motifs embroidered on a large silk canopy from Multan
                    (figure 22). And, despite its apparently Greek name, the
                    scrolling leaf and flower motifs in Jones’s ‘Athens’ woven
                    satin furnishing fabric for Warner, 1870–74 (figure 23)
                    closely resemble those found in Indian woven silks such as
                    the woven silk and gold-wrapped thread sari (figurev24) and
                    the related example illustrated in the Grammar (figure 25).

                  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                  <p>
                    While comparisons such as these can become a self-serving
                    exercise, the identification of Owen Jones’s primary source
                    material in the V&amp;A’s Indian textile collections has
                    some value. It provides specific evidence of the high
                    aesthetic esteem placed on Indian artefacts, specifically
                    textiles, by the founders of the Museum and the accompanying
                    nationwide programme of art education. It permits a clearer
                    understanding of the meaning of the principles of good
                    design formed by Jones and his colleagues, and in the case
                    of Jones particularly, how these could be translated into
                    manufactured designs. It also highlights the limitations of
                    translating objects into two-dimensional images, however
                    fine the quality of printing in the case of the Grammar of
                    Ornament. For the textile pieces illustrated were
                    three-dimensional objects, with the texture and
                    (highly-valued) irregularities of the hand-made.
                    Furthermore, most of them were made to be worn, to move with
                    the human body, and to be seen in very different climatic
                    conditions and contexts from those of darkest, gas-lit
                    Victorian England. Seeing these objects next to their
                    ‘mechanical reproduction’ may bring some of these
                    differences into relief.

                    In terms of the global migration of design motifs, these
                    examples provide a very specific illustration of the way in
                    which traditional patterns of Asian textiles could be
                    mediated through a network of taste arbiters to reach an
                    exhibition in South Kensington, the pages of a ground
                    breaking design manual, and the domestic design productions
                    of nineteenth-century manufacturers of furnishing textiles
                    and wallpaper.

                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    Owen Jones’s Grammar of Ornament has been an influential
                    design manual for more than 150 years, yet its material
                    sources have not been properly examined. Newly observed
                    connections between the ‘Indian Ornament’ illustrated in the
                    Grammar and textiles in the V&amp;A collections, selected by
                    Jones and his colleagues, may enable better understanding of
                    Jones’s aesthetic principles, and the sources of his own
                    design work.

                          in both colonial (1850s to 1880s) and post-colonial
                          (1980s to 2000s) times. Research in the V&amp;A is
                          investigating three sets of acquisitions made between
                          1852 and 1883: purchases from the 1851 Great
                          Exhibition; John Forbes Watson’s Collections of the
                          Textile Manufactures of India (First Series 1866,
                          Second Series 1873–77); and the textiles sent back to
                          South Kensington from India by Caspar Purdon Clarke
                          during his 1881–82 trip to buy objects for the
                          Museum’s Indian collections.

                    Quilt making fulfils a number of roles for the maker and
                    society: the process of making may represent an act of
                    remembrance, a rite of passage (say a wedding or a birth) or
                    provide a forum for overt political or social
                    commentary.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn1" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    Stitching may be a solitary occupation, a moment to reflect
                    or meditate, or a communal activity, as illustrated by the
                    evocative image of the quilting bee.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn2" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;The beautifully crafted quilts produced either in
                    isolation or in communities form part of a cultural
                    continuum that transcends time and place; their makers
                    creating both ‘personal and historical legacies’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn3" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The process of making can also be a challenge, forcing the
                    maker to admit and face up to stark truths and harsh
                    realities, particularly those associated with the untimely
                    or tragic death of a loved one. In this case, the creation
                    of a tangible memorial to a lost family member or friend
                    provides succour in the aftermath of a personal tragedy; the
                    physical act of stitching also acts as a lynchpin on the
                    therapeutic road to emotional recovery. Cloth, with its
                    complex and fascinating history, has long been acknowledged
                    as playing a key role in retaining and communicating both
                    personal and communal memories, those complex narratives
                    which make up our own and our ancestral lives. Kathryn
                    Sullivan Kruger believes that ‘[A] piece of fabric transmits
                    information about the society which created it in a manner
                    not dissimilar to a written language, except that in this
                    case the grammar is printed in the cloth’s fibre, pattern,
                    dye and method of production.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn4" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                    The monumental ‘AIDS Memorial Quilt’ and ‘National Tribute
                    Quilt: A September 11 Memorial’ both reflect the collective
                    efforts of individuals and communities to come to terms with
                    tragic and untimely loss, focusing on specific events in
                    recent history. These objects, with their intimate
                    associations of warmth, comfort and the security of home
                    therefore become public metaphors in times of national and
                    international tragedy and instability.

                  <h2>Collective Memories</h2>
                  <p>
                    Initially organised at a local level in the mid-1980s, ‘The
                    AIDS Memorial Quilt’ has since evolved into an international
                    project. The extraordinary number of individually stitched
                    panels commemorates the thousands of men, women and children
                    who have died of the disease since 1985.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn5" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    Colleagues, friends, families and lovers have all
                    contributed to what has become known as the world’s largest
                    living memorial. Unlike most collective monuments to the
                    dead, the majority of which consist of seemingly impersonal
                    lists of names and dates incised into stone or marble, ‘The
                    AIDS Memorial Quilt’ is unique in celebrating the
                    individuality of the people who have died. Personal tokens,
                    mementoes and memories are crafted into many of the panels.
                    When the panels are assembled the quilt functions not only
                    as a conduit for the grief and anger of those who have lost
                    a loved one, but also as a celebration of a life lived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a unique chapter in the formation of the quilt, fashion
                    designer Rifat Ozbek approached key individuals in the
                    fashion industry to design panels dedicated to colleagues
                    whose deaths had decimated the creative industries. A small
                    publication documents and illustrates a selection of these
                    panels,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn6" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    including some of the written tributes. These poignant and,
                    in some cases, intensely personal dedications, reinforce the
                    power of the medium to bear witness to both individual and
                    universal suffering. Ben de Lisi focused on the loss of a
                    ‘silver-haired man [who] was a true friend under all
                    circumstances … [who] nurtured and nourished us … To say we
                    loved him would be an understatement. To say we needed him
                    would be obvious. To say we miss him … we will always miss
                    him.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn7" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    Helen Storey directed her anger at the unfairness of the
                    disease, at ‘the painful passivity displayed on the faces of
                    children for whom life is defined by disease … A seemingly
                    godless earth to allow a being unable to shape its own
                    destiny.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn8" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                    Exhibited on both sides of the Atlantic, the quilt is also
                    used as an educational tool: as the rate of HIV infection
                    among young people continues to rise, the significance of
                    ‘The AIDS Memorial Quilt’ continues to resonate, telling ‘a
                    story significant to the time in which it was
                    created’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn9" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup></strong>

                    ‘The National Tribute Quilt’, like ‘The AIDS Memorial
                    Quilt’, functions both as a personal commemoration and as a
                    symbol of national unity. Initiated by the Steel Quilters in
                    Pittsburgh,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn10" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    the 3 metre × 10 metre quilt includes the name of every
                    individual who lost their life in the 11 September 2001
                    terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Designed as a
                    series of six panels, it has four central panels based on an
                    image of the New York City skyline, complete with the twin
                    towers of the World Trade Center. The central section of the
                    quilt is flanked on the left by a panel which includes the
                    names of passengers and crew who lost their lives on Flights
                    11, 93, 175 and 77, surmounted by a pair of white doves. The
                    right hand panel commemorates individuals who died at the
                    Pentagon. This panel is dominated by the profile of the head
                    of an eagle, a symbolic metaphor for both the Pentagon and
                    the USA.

                    The Steel Quilters, a group of four experienced quilters and
                    stitchers, were moved to construct a lasting memorial to the
                    dead while watching media coverage of the tragedy. Kathy
                    Crawford describes being moved by the composure of a
                    co-worker’s family whose son had died on his first day
                    working in the World Trade Center; 'The father’s strength
                    and composure inspired us to make this quilt, not just for
                    one family, but for all the families who must share in the
                    grief. A quilt which would not only serve as a way to
                    forever remember and pay tribute to those lost, but also
                    give comfort to their families knowing that others truly
                    cared about their loved ones.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn11" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>
                    The Steel Quilters extended their project to the wider
                    community via a website that invited individuals interested
                    in contributing a square to contact them for the name of a
                    victim. Kathy Crawford provides an explanation for the
                    overwhelming response to the project: ‘Many block
                    contributors researched the person to whom they were paying
                    tribute. Many cried while making their blocks, feeling close
                    to someone that they had never met but with whom now they
                    have a bond. Many wrote mails and letters accompanying their
                    blocs, expressing their gratefulness for this project for
                    helping them to get through emotions which many of us have
                    never experienced before.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn12" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                    The complexity of creating a memorial which contains 3466
                    squares was offset by a grid reference system that enables
                    each name to be located on the quilt and in the accompanying
                    record book (the book also contains the square-maker’s
                    name).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Central to the act of remembrance through the creation of
                    memorials is the ability to record the name of the deceased.
                    The unprecedented nature of the tragedy of 9/11added an
                    unforeseen complexity to the creation of ‘The National
                    Tribute Quilt’. The Steel Quilters used the list of victims
                    provided by the media giant CNN as the basis for their
                    website appeal. As the list of names was constantly being
                    revised and updated, the task became increasingly
                    complicated. The Steel Quilters’ decision to add a
                    disclaimer to the website appeal was both pragmatic and
                    practical – the quilt had gone through a process of
                    modification, as names were removed or spellings amended,
                    and squares were removed or altered to reflect the change.
                    The importance of ensuring that the memory of each
                    individual is correctly recorded is central to the act of
                    remembrance – failure to do this would invalidate both
                    memorial and, metaphorically, the individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The success and level of response to the ‘The National
                    Tribute Quilt’ owes much to the way in which the American
                    quilting tradition is firmly entrenched in the nation’s
                    psyche. For many, quilt making is synonymous with the
                    creation of a national identity; it represents the
                    pioneering spirit of the early settlers on their arduous
                    journey west, the mythology of ‘The Underground Railroad’

                    nineteenth-century quilting ‘bees’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn14" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>
                    On continuous display at the American Folk Art Museum, New
                    York, the quilt represents both personal and collective
                    memories.

                  <h2>‘Memoriam’ – A Personal Testament (2002)</h2>
                  <p>
                    Community projects such as ‘The AIDS Memorial Quilt’ and
                    ‘The National Tribute Quilt’ fulfil a specific function in
                    society – a catalyst for emotion and commemoration. When
                    community projects focus on major events with international
                    repercussions, the resulting quilts are recognised and
                    classified as cultural icons. In contrast, Michele Walker’s
                    ‘In Memoriam’, a plastic and wire wool quilt, is more
                    difficult to read. Dedicated to her mother, Walker’s
                    referencing of the distressing symptoms experienced by
                    individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s disease is a complex
                    combination of personal narrative, social commentary and
                    traditional quilt making skills.

                    Trained as a graphic designer, Walker’s two publications
                    celebrate both the unknown makers of traditional North
                    Country quilts and the work of contemporary
                    practitioners.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn15" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup></strong>
                    Walker, one of a small group of contemporary artists who
                    revived interest in British quilt making in the 1970s and
                    early 1980s,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn16" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    continues to create complex and multi-layered quilts and
                    installations. Lesley Millar, curator of the cross-cultural
                    exhibition ‘Cloth and Culture Now’, believes that many
                    practitioners who consciously draw on indigenous textile
                    traditions use ‘the cultural space presented by the domestic
                    history of the making and use of textiles, to move between
                    [both] the personal and the political’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn17" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Memoriam’ is the last quilt in a body of work which draws
                    inspiration from the patterns, stitches and ethos of
                    traditional quilt making – the incorporation of everyday,
                    cast-off scraps and fabrics used to make both decorative and
                    functional bed covers. Walker’s ability to both understand
                    and interpret the origins and traditions of this craft
                    provides her with a medium with which to engage with social,
                    political and environment issues in a way which is both
                    accessible and relevant. Walker states, ‘My work deals with
                    re-interpreting the traditional quilt. Inspiration comes
                    from what I experience and observe around me. It is
                    essential that the content of the work reflects the time in
                    which it is made … I aim in my work to challenge the
                    associations and meaning of the word quilt.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn18" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup></strong>
                    An earlier work, ‘Waste Not, Want Not’ (1993),<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn19" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup></strong>
                    thus not only engages the viewer in the topical debate
                    regarding recycling, but also references the ‘make do and
                    mend’ tradition of crafting objects from the ephemera of our
                    everyday lives. Constructed from frozen food packaging,
                    plastic bags, fabric and photocopies, ‘Waste Not, Want Not’
                    is both an emotional and intellectual response to the
                    environmental issues which continue to resonate across the
                    globe. In ‘Assault and Battery 3’ (2001),<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn20" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup></strong>
                    Walker again combines her knowledge of the North Country
                    quilt making tradition with direct criticism of battery
                    farming. Made in response to a report published by
                    Compassion in World Farming,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn21" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup></strong>
                    ‘Assault and Battery 3’ is a rectangular quilt constructed
                    from plastic materials, wadding, Vilene and feathers. It is
                    the third in a series of quilts based on factory farming.
                    The imagery, a pair of large white feathers against a black
                    rectangular background, references the ‘running feather’
                    quilting pattern used in traditional North Country
                    whole-cloth quilts. The aesthetic reading of the quilt is
                    subverted by the title – an overt commentary on the
                    conditions related to factory farmed poultry, especially
                    turkey rearing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Walker’s interest in traditional British patchwork and
                    quilting extends beyond materials and techniques.
                    Underpinning her research is her fascination with the lives
                    of the often unknown working class women who produced
                    whole-cloth quilts, objects which are, on the whole,
                    unsigned and undated but retain the fading memory of
                    traditional folk crafts of rural and mining communities.
                    Walker’s concern is well founded: the seminal 1971
                    exhibition ‘Abstract Art in American Quilts’ held at the
                    Whitney Museum of Modern Art in New York may have catapulted
                    the crafted object into the fine art arena, yet the makers
                    remained conspicuously absent.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn22" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup></strong>
                    In contrast, the phenomenal success of the Gees Bend quilts
                    is as much a response to the social history and
                    documentation project, and the ability to trace the lineage
                    of the makers, as it is to the aesthetic quality of the
                    work.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn23" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is this emphasis on ‘disappearance’ – both physical and
                    metaphorical – that underpins Walker’s ‘Memoriam’. On the
                    surface, the work can be read in terms of a commemoration of
                    the erosion of traditional skills and the identities of the
                    women who practiced them. Dedicated to her dead mother,
                    ‘Memoriam’ is firmly rooted in the tradition of
                    commemorative quilts, yet its underlying focus is as much on
                    the loss of an individual’s memory as it is on remembrance.
                    Walker’s intensely personal yet deeply complex exploration
                    of the distressing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease can in
                    many ways be compared with the origins of ‘The AIDS Memorial
                    Quilt’ – anger at an apparent lack of support for sufferers
                    from Government agencies and a desire to increase awareness
                    of the disease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A progressive and fatal brain disease, Alzheimer’s destroys
                    brain cells, resulting in serious memory loss, deterioration
                    in thinking and concentration, and severe behavioural
                    problems, and is the most common form of dementia. In
                    discussing ‘Memoriam’, Walker describes how her mother
                    developed dementia and eventually lost both her memory and
                    her sense of identity, a process which is translated into
                    the stitching of the quilt. The sculptural quality of the
                    stitched layers of clear plastic over the metallic grey of
                    the wire wool acquires a more macabre subtext when it is
                    revealed that the design is based on the pattern of Walker’s
                    own skin. Traditionally, quilt makers would use inanimate
                    objects as aids in drawing patterns to be stitched – the
                    plates, cups, even chair seats which were readily available
                    in every home.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn24" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup></strong>
                    Walker has replicated this process, drawing attention to the
                    transitory nature of the life itself by using her own,
                    animate body as a template, creating a surface pattern at
                    once aesthetically intriguing and emotionally unsettling.
                    Equally, the incorporation of wire wool into the work
                    functions as both material (traditional whole-cloth quilts
                    use wool or cotton as wadding) and as a metaphor for decay –
                    the wire wool gradually reacts to exposure to the atmosphere
                    and in time decays. Here Walker draws again on her knowledge
                    of quilting techniques, piecing each section of the quilt in
                    the manner of a late nineteenth-century ‘crazy’
                    quilt;<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn25" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup></strong>
                    an ironic reference to the continuing trend to
                    ‘institutionalise’ or hide the mentally ill, a reference
                    which is reinforced by the use of the industrial grey wire
                    wool, a colour most often associated with hospitals or
                    asylums. Walker’s powers of observation are both acute and
                    disturbing. She describes the meaning behind the twisted and
                    knotted wire wool borders of the quilt, ‘As my mother lost
                    her memory she became obsessive about everyday things, small
                    things that didn’t really matter; she would sit and twist
                    and tease her hair. I noticed that many of us obsessively
                    twist our hair without realising, particularly when lost in
                    thought’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn26" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup></strong>
                    This laying bare of an intensely personal narrative, in a
                    medium that is both familiar yet abstract is, in Jane
                    Jakeman’s view, ‘sometimes uncomfortably negotiated into
                    public space’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn27" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup></strong>
                    Yet Walker’s exploration of the self, both in terms of
                    recreating through stitch the patterns of her skin, and
                    referencing the absence of her mother, both physically and
                    metaphorically through the loss of her identity, create an
                    evocative continuum with the unknown makers of the
                    past.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn28" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup></strong>
                    The quilt, so often associated with gift giving and
                    traditionally handed down as an heirloom through the female
                    line, and a symbol of familial female heritage, becomes a
                    highly charged and complex study of the relationship between
                    mother and daughter. Walker states ‘The “emptiness” of the
                    quilt evokes the void I felt during those years. Working
                    with an uncomfortable tactical material like wire wool
                    seemed to be symbolic of those bittersweet memories. The
                    work was made several years after my mother’s death (in
                    1998); I needed that period of time to distance myself from
                    what had happened and have a period of reflection.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn29" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    In the study accompanying ‘In Memoriam’, Walker has included
                    a piece of her mother’s wedding veil, looped and stitched to
                    reference the universal remembrance ribbons that started
                    with AIDS awareness. The red ribbon, traditionally worn on
                    World AIDS Day and throughout the year to raise awareness of
                    HIV and AIDS, has been adopted by a number of charities –
                    the meaning behind each ribbon dependent on its colour or
                    colours.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn30" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup></strong>
                    The ribbon has also become a symbol of American unity,
                    replicated in the pattern of the American flag and the
                    strapline ‘Support Freedom’. Walker has explored the
                    significance of the awareness ribbon in an earlier work
                    ‘Remember Me’ (1999).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn31" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup></strong>
                    However, in this context the use of a personal memento is
                    again symbolic of Walker’s ability to move beyond the
                    obvious. Juxtaposed with ‘Memoriam’, the study is a poignant
                    reminder of both the hopes and fears of a young bride at the
                    start of her new life. As our mothers hand down these
                    physical heirlooms, so too do they hand down our histories
                    in the form of stories and narratives that help to cement
                    our sense of identity. The inability to recall those
                    narratives, the loss of our own histories, challenges the
                    enduring importance of the mother/daughterrelationship and
                    begs the question ‘Who am I, where do I come from’?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Memoriam’ has most recently been included in ‘The Fabric of
                    Myth’ exhibition held at Compton Verney. Antonia Harrison,
                    co-curator of the exhibition, agrees that Walker’s use of
                    unconventional materials challenges our perceptions of the
                    quilt, its ability to evoke memories of warmth and security
                    and our poignant recollections of mothers kissing us
                    goodnight. Yet the scale of ‘Memoriam’, unlike the
                    monumental ‘AIDS Memorial Quilt’ and ‘The National Tribute
                    Quilt’, recalls the domestic and the intimate, &nbsp; as does
                    Walker’s decision to display the quilt horizontally, a
                    reference to the quilt’s traditional function as bed cover.
                    Walker is adamant that the quilt should be placed on a high
                    plinth, creating the impression of a medieval effigy or the
                    tombs of the great and the good, whose names are forever
                    immortalised in stone and marble. This analogy is again
                    heightened by Walker’s use of materials, the exclusion of
                    soft feminine fabrics, chintz and florals, in favour of
                    ‘hard’ plastic and wire wool. Harrison echoes this
                    comparison, ‘The quilt that would normally be passed down
                    through generations retaining memory has instead become a
                    shrine to its loss’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn32" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup></strong>

                    ‘The AIDS Memorial Quilt’ and ‘The National Tribute Quilt’
                    bring private grief and anger to a very public forum.
                    Although criticised by some as overly sentimental,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn33" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup></strong>
                    the quilts provide a focus for both commemoration and
                    campaigning. ‘Memoriam’ is, first and foremost, a work of
                    art: its meaning complex and multi-layered. Yet it also
                    commemorates a very private relationship and personal loss.
                    Walker believes that her interest in memory and identity,
                    both personal and collective, emerged through the experience
                    of ageing. ‘With the loss of parents you start to question
                    things, to witness my mother’s mental decline was a terrible
                    event but in a way it gave me a new insight. I had taken
                    memory and therefore a sense of identity always for granted,
                    but when you are close to someone who has lost their memory
                    and connection with you as their daughter – well, that sense
                    of loss takes on a different relevance’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-keepsakes-of-identity-fn34" id="page-keepsakes-of-identity-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup></strong>

                          ‘The Steel Quilters’ consists of a small group of

                          and Technology Center. Based in Monroeville, near
                          Pittsburgh PA, the four women co-ordinated the
                          nationwide project. It took 12 volunteers (all women)
                          two days to lay out the 3466 squares on a grid. It
                          took 250 hours to stitch the quilt together.

                          The vogue for ‘crazy patchwork’; the elaborate and
                          colourful combination of silks, satins and velvets
                          swept the UK, America and Australia. Although
                          considered by some to be garish and in poor taste,
                          contemporary reports hailed it as both fashionable and
                          versatile, being equally suitable for piano covers,
                          antimacassars, sofa pillows and table covers. Often
                          embellished with an accomplished range of embroidery
                          stitches, these cushions and tea cosies provide
                          evidence of the vibrant dress fashions of the period.
                          The V&amp;A has one crazy patchwork table cover in the
                          collection (V&amp;A museum no.T.682-1994).

                          In 2000 Walker visited Japan in conjunction with an
                          exhibition about contemporary British quilted
                          textiles. Here she discovered sashiko and became
                          interested in the indigo-dyed garments used for work
                          clothes. A three-year AHRC Fellowship enabled Walker
                          to research sashiko textiles and women who made them.
                          Walker states, ‘Similar to those who made quilts in
                          Britain; the majority of these Japanese women lived in
                          working class communities and were considered ordinary
                          and unimportant. Their lives centred on survival. My
                          research into personal histories has only been made
                          possible through friendships that have gradually
                          evolved with a few women who are now in their late
                          eighties or nineties and to whom sashiko is still
                          remembered as being significant in their lives’. (In
                          conversation with the author 30 August 2007). Walker’s
                          research culminated in two exhibitions: ‘Memory
                          Sticks’, Fabrica, Brighton Festival, May 2005, and
                          ‘Stitching for Survival’ University Gallery, Brighton,
                          October 2007. A full transcript of the Author’s
                          interview with Walker by the author accompanied this
                          exhibition.

                    For many visitors to the exhibition
                    <em>James ‘Athenian’ Stuart: the Rediscovery of Antiquity</em>
                    (Bard Graduate Center, New York, 2006–7; Victoria and Albert
                    Museum 15 March – 24 June 2007) the surprise was not the
                    quality of Stuart’s lost buildings and interiors so much as
                    the striking examples of his art as a painter. The
                    exhibition featured eighteen landscape views, thirteen of
                    which were engraved for the first two volumes of
                    <em>Antiquities of Athens</em> (1762; 1787–9) by Stuart and
                    Nicholas Revett.

                    On loan from the Drawings Collection of the Royal Institute
                    of British Architects (RIBA), they had never been exhibited
                    as a group before. They have also never been published and
                    discussed as a group.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn1" id="page-james-stuart-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    <em>Antiquities of Athens</em> set new standards for
                    archaeological publications, boasting measurements to an
                    impossible hair’s-breadth degree of accuracy (one thousandth
                    of an inch, a fraction made meaningless by thermal variation
                    in both instruments and buildings). Stuart had returned from
                    Athens in 1755 but felt driven to such exacting standards by
                    a rushed rival publication, ‘Les Ruines des plus beaux
                    monuments de la Grèce’ by Julien-David LeRoy (Paris, 1758).
                    Stuart’s mathematical calculations sharpened up the measured
                    drawings of buildings that had been made by Revett. Stuart’s
                    landscape views also seem to have been sharpened up to outdo
                    the views by LeRoy, whose volume was conceived more in the
                    genre of philosophical travel literature. Far more familiar
                    today are the images of another rival, the fantastical views
                    of Rome by G. B. Piranesi, whose ‘Della Magnificenza ed
                    Architettura de’ Romani’ (1761) was published the year
                    before Stuart and Revett’s much-anticipated first volume.
                    Lacking Piranesi’s awe-struck admirers, shrunken to
                    exaggerate the apparent scale and sublimity of Rome’s
                    monuments, Stuart’s views may seem conventional. However,
                    they are worthy of attention and further research in their
                    own right as a contribution to the history of British
                    landscape painting, for their origins in the art of
                    decorating fans, for the unusual use of gouache, and for
                    their exceptional ethnographical content.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn2" id="page-james-stuart-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    In their high finish and topographical information they
                    anticipate by two decades the views of Rome and Tivoli by
                    Louis Ducros (1748–1810) that British collectors framed and
                    hung to resemble oil paintings.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn3" id="page-james-stuart-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>

                    Since Stuart’s death tradition has held that his failure to
                    establish a Grecian style of design, befitting Britain’s new
                    supremacy as head of a maritime mercantile empire, was owing
                    to his own laziness, ‘epicureanism’ and the determined
                    competition of Robert Adam and William Chambers to promote
                    the Roman school. But for much of his career Stuart saw
                    himself primarily as a painter. Unlike Adam he was not
                    groomed in a family of architects; unlike Chambers he had no
                    formal training as an architect in Paris. Apprenticed to the
                    French artist Louis Goupy (<em>c</em>.1674–1747), his
                    brother William or their nephew Joseph Goupy (1686–1763),
                    Stuart worked as a fan painter in London until he was
                    twenty-seven; he then walked to Rome, painting fans as he
                    went to pay his way. In the published proposal of 1748 for
                    the Antiquities he explains that he and his collaborator,
                    Revett, have been ‘at Rome, where we had already employed 6
                    or 7 years in the study of Painting’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn4" id="page-james-stuart-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                    The exhibition included portraits by Stuart of James Lee
                    (Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, University of Glasgow)
                    and a self portrait by Revett (RIBA), the journeyman
                    character of which suggests that both painters may have
                    regarded architectural field research as a necessary career
                    change. Stuart’s dual interest, together with his standing
                    as a connoisseur and cicerone, is confirmed by a surviving
                    sketchbook, one half of which is devoted to architecture,
                    the other to drafts of a treatise on Venetian
                    painting.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn5" id="page-james-stuart-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the published proposal for
                    <em>Antiquities of Athens</em> Stuart offered not only
                    accurate records of buildings and sculpture but also of each
                    building’s ‘circumjacent Country’ in ‘drawings made on the
                    spot … by the hand of an Artist’. Only three of Stuart’s
                    seventy-seven notebooks survive and only one of the field
                    sketches for the vedute has been located.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn6" id="page-james-stuart-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    Despite Stuart’s claim in the Antiquities that they were
                    ‘painted on the spot’ the differences between the sketch and
                    the finished gouaches suggests that all eighteen may have
                    been painted, or extensively worked up, in London. There he
                    joined the artist circles of the St Martin’s Lane Academy,
                    numbering among his friends Hogarth and Reynolds. On the
                    strength of his field research alone Stuart presented and
                    promoted himself as a man of dual profession, not primarily
                    as an architect but rather as a painter. On being elected a
                    Fellow of the Royal Society in 1758 he is recorded as a
                    ‘history painter and architect’. On his election to the
                    Society of Antiquaries the same year he described himself as
                    a ‘painter and architect’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn7" id="page-james-stuart-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    His earliest known commission was for portraits of William
                    III and George II for the Rockingham Club (unlocated). In
                    1758 he painted for Westminster School the stage backdrop
                    for their annual Latin play. In 1763 he succeeded George
                    Knapton as portrait painter to the Society of Dilettanti (a
                    position he relinquished to Reynolds in 1769 having failed
                    to produce a single portrait) and in 1764 he succeeded
                    Hogarth as Sergeant-Painter of the Office of Works (a post
                    he held until 1782). In 1764 he employed the young James
                    Barry (1741–1806) to produce oil paintings based on his
                    views of Athens.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn8" id="page-james-stuart-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                    A member of over twenty committees at the Society for the
                    Promotion of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, Stuart served
                    as a judge of the premiums for painting and drawing. Between
                    1765 and 1783 he exhibited 122 works at the Free Society,
                    including designs, book illustrations and paintings with
                    mythological or allegorical subjects. As none of his easel
                    paintings are located today, these gouaches now provide the
                    best evidence of Stuart’s abilities as a landscape painter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One reason for Stuart’s omission from histories of British
                    landscape painting is that gouache (or ‘bodycolour’) is
                    regarded as a continental tradition, one that falls between
                    watercolour and oil painting.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn9" id="page-james-stuart-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup></strong>
                    Unlike in ‘pure’ watercolour, the colours are not mixed
                    simply in water and do not achieve their brilliancy through
                    their translucency over white paper. In gouache, the colours
                    are mixed in water, gum and lead white (after its invention
                    in 1834, Chinese white was used as it did not darken) and
                    can be applied over tinted or blue, grey or buff paper.
                    Working from dark to light, as in oil painting and
                    engraving, the painter in gouache uses an opaque medium and
                    so can correct mistakes. The relative visual weight and
                    strength of colour of gouache made it suitable for fan
                    painting and it became popular among watercolour painters
                    who sought to compete at exhibitions where their works might
                    be hung near oil paintings in relatively dim interiors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ‘father’ of the British school of watercolour painting,
                    Paul Sandby (1731–1809) used gouache for topographical views
                    painted for exhibition from the 1760s. Sandby owned several
                    gouaches by Marco Ricci (1670–1729) who worked in Britain
                    between 1712 and 1716. Ricci’s friend, Joseph Goupy, painted
                    in gouache fans and reduced copies of old master paintings
                    for fashionable society. Another source of this continental
                    influence was the landscape painter Francesco Zuccarelli
                    (1702–88) who worked in Britain in the 1740s and between
                    1752 and 1773. Collectors also helped introduce the medium
                    to Britain, notably William Windham who, in 1742, returned
                    from Italy to Felbrigg in Norfolk with twenty-six gouaches
                    of scenes near Rome, painted by Giovanni Battista Busiri
                    (1698–1757). Ricci was promoted among British visitors to
                    Venice by Consul Smith, from whom George III acquired over
                    thirty gouaches by the artist in about 1762. Particularly
                    popular among gentlemen on the Grand Tour were the gouache
                    views of Roman monuments painted by Charles-Louis Clérisseau
                    (1721–1820) in Italy between 1749 and 1767. In 1757
                    Clérisseau travelled with Robert Adam to Split to record the
                    Emperor Diocletian’s palace, which Adam published in 1764.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stuart’s gouaches record two excursions to survey monuments.
                    Five views are of the Roman antiquities at Pola (now Pula)
                    in Istria, Croatia, where Stuart and Revett practised their
                    recording techniques while waiting for permission to travel
                    from Venice into Greece. Athens had been occupied by the
                    Ottoman Turks for the past 300 years and was a dangerous and
                    unknown land to the British. LeRoy, by contrast, was to
                    benefit from better relations between the French consul and
                    the Turks. The other thirteen gouaches represent Greek
                    monuments in Athens and Thessalonika. Stuart’s vivid,
                    colourful and detailed depictions of the monuments in their
                    contemporary settings, amidst Turkish buildings set off by
                    carefully-observed scenes of local life, must have been
                    astonishing at the time. As images of a country regarded as
                    the birthplace of western culture yet almost unknown to
                    living travellers from the west, Stuart’s paintings could
                    have aroused as much interest as the first photographs from
                    the lunar surface. Compositionally, several appear to follow
                    the semi-circular format to which Stuart must have become
                    accustomed as a fan painter. The vivid colours and wealth of
                    anecdotal incident at the centre and base of each image were
                    customary requirements to enhance any fan when wielded by a
                    social wallflower, whether in self-defence or as a source of
                    shared amusement. The screening and framing devices used in
                    some, such as arches or trees in silhouette in the
                    foreground, suggest that the paintings may have been
                    finished to hang together as a group.

                  <p>
                    Compared to British topographical watercolours of the 1750s,
                    Stuart’s views are exceptional, not only in using the
                    gouache medium but also in the care with which he has
                    created figure compositions and recorded local costume. Paul
                    Sandby may have been influenced by Stuart’s example in the
                    figure groups in his topographical watercolours of British
                    antiquities. Michael ‘Angelo’ Rooker (1746–1801) is known to
                    have used engravings after Dutch seventeenth-century
                    painters to animate his views of ruined abbeys and castles
                    with rustic figures.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn10" id="page-james-stuart-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    Through exhibiting at the Free Society and through his
                    publications Stuart could have set a new standard for
                    picturesque staffage. Stuart’s figures have an
                    ethnographical quality that anticipates the topographical
                    views commissioned by publishers from J. M. W. Turner
                    (1775–1851). The more immediate heir of Stuart’s concern to
                    record both the antiquities and the street life of modern
                    Greece is William Pars (1742–82) who accompanied Revett in a
                    similar expedition between 1764 and 1766 that resulted in
                    the Ionian Antiquities (1769, 1797) which was also sponsored
                    by the Society of Dilettanti.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn11" id="page-james-stuart-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stuart and Revett star in their own production, their cameo
                    roles in the gouaches serving to verify their actual
                    presence in Greece. Here is the proof that they heeded
                    Stuart’s own advice, as expressed in the published proposal
                    for the Antiquities: ‘Artists who aim at perfection must …
                    approach the Fountain-Head of their art’. They first appear
                    at Pola, standing precariously on top of the Arch of the
                    Sergii where Stuart is shown taking notes while Revett
                    measures the monument. In the view of the Monument of
                    Philopappus above Athens, Stuart and Revett wear Turkish
                    kaftans while chatting with James Dawkins while Robert Wood
                    copies down inscriptions. (Dawkins and Wood visited Athens
                    in May 1751 and later published their own books on the
                    antiquities of Palmyra and Baalbec).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn12" id="page-james-stuart-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                    The visitors may have been included by way of
                    acknowledgement of Dawkins’s sponsorship of the project.
                    This is the least finished of the gouaches and lacks the
                    servant making coffee that appears in the published
                    engraving. This difference further suggests that the
                    gouaches were worked up, if not entirely painted, in London.
                    In addition to the recorded assistance from James Barry,
                    there is the visual evidence of other hands at work in the
                    gouaches, such as the poorly-drawn group of riders in the
                    view of the Temple of Apollo at Corinth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Revett appears sketching in the foreground of the view of
                    the Theatre of Bacchus. His Turkish dress underlines the
                    artists’ presence on site and further suggests both their
                    need to avoid drawing attention to themselves and the years
                    of field study when their clothes would simply have worn
                    out. Stuart chose to present himself on the Acropolis,
                    sketching the Caryatid Porch of the Erechtheion, presumably
                    as this was the source of the Ionic order that he would
                    employ in his own designs. The published text may be
                    indebted to LeRoy’s first volume in its sense of travelogue.
                    Stuart describes how his labourers are excavating beneath
                    the caryatids while Turkish officials and spies keep watch
                    to prevent them removing treasures, convinced that there
                    could be no other point in digging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To the view of the Ionic Temple on the River Ilissus (a
                    monument destroyed by the Turks around 1778) Stuart has
                    added a colourful scene of the Turkish governor hunting with
                    his entourage, a picturesque detail not in the field sketch.
                    While Revett produced the measured outlines of the ancient
                    buildings Stuart took the opportunity of these vedute to
                    record the landscape setting, the encroaching miscellany of
                    later constructions, the local way of life and to document
                    the extent of their own labours as archaeologists (no doubt,
                    once again, to outdo his rival LeRoy). In his view of the
                    Tower of the Winds, set against the fortified walls of the
                    Acropolis, he shows his workmen excavating the doorway.
                    Stuart and Revett did not simply measure and paint but also
                    had 2,700 cubic feet of earth removed from the interior,
                    taking it down some fourteen feet to its original floor
                    level, and in so doing discovered the tower’s original
                    function as a water clock. Stuart also notes that it is now
                    a Turkish chapel where whirling dervishes dance inside. They
                    even took the trouble to dismantle a house adjoining the
                    tower in order to see all eight sides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stuart was affable company and could not keep his sense of
                    humour out of his work. The panoramic view of the interior
                    of the amphitheatre at Pola has its foreground filled with a
                    scene of a friar blessing a flock of diseased sheep and in
                    the view of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, embedded in
                    the wall of a monastery, a dozing monk seated before a skull
                    enjoys the cool shade of a well-tended vegetable garden.

                    Art history may have been kind to Stuart in leaving lost his
                    endeavours as a history painter in oils. According to the
                    greatest living painter of the day, Anton Raphael Mengs
                    (1728–79), Stuart was an artist of ‘superior genius’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn13" id="page-james-stuart-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup></strong>
                    According to James Barry, ‘The pictures, and every thing of
                    his designing, are distinguished by that unaffected air of
                    the ancients, which alone constitutes true taste’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn14" id="page-james-stuart-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>
                    However, Stuart’s ceiling paintings in the Tapestry Room at
                    Hagley Hall (1758–9) are in a late rococo mode. His gifts as
                    a landscape painter of detail and colour were put to better
                    use in enriching his designs for interiors at
                    Kedleston.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn15" id="page-james-stuart-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup></strong>
                    These designs were seen in December 1758 by his rival Robert
                    Adam (1728–92) who learnt from them how to seduce clients
                    with his characteristic colourful presentation drawings of
                    complete interiors. In his designs for Kedleston’s interiors
                    Stuart showed that he still fancied his chances as a painter
                    of large oil paintings for he included a history painting
                    showing the capture of Bacchus by pirates (based on the
                    scene in the frieze of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates)
                    and a double full-length portrait of his patron with his
                    wife. Neither was commissioned. When he did secure a
                    commission, to decorate Georgiana Spencer’s closet at
                    Wimbledon House with scenes from Milton (1758, destroyed by
                    fire 1785), Horace Walpole described it as ‘villainously
                    painted’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn16" id="page-james-stuart-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    Best known today is Stuart’s Painted Room at Spencer House,
                    London, where he and assistants painted from 1758 grotesque
                    decoration in the spirit of Raphael’s garden loggia of the
                    Villa Madama around inset paintings that do not suggest any
                    great loss.

                  <p>
                    The influence of Stuart’s gouaches should not be
                    underestimated as they were available through engravings and
                    included in public exhibitions. Of the 122 works exhibited
                    by Stuart at the Free Society, eighty-two related to the
                    Antiquities of Athens. As exhibition pieces, they would have
                    promoted the authority of Stuart as an intrepid field
                    researcher and the myth of Greece as both the cradle of
                    civilisation and as a nation under alien occupation. There
                    must be many more awaiting rediscovery. After his death
                    seven were included in the sale of Stuart’s effects; two
                    were sold at Phillips in 1799. The present group was donated
                    to the RIBA in 1873.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-james-stuart-fn17" id="page-james-stuart-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>

                  <h2>1&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
                  <p>
                    The V&amp;A identifies its audience in terms of six
                    definitions of visitor type, which are not mutually
                    exclusive. They are: independent adults, students, families,
                    organised groups, schools and adults from the Creative
                    Industries (CI). Whilst the V&amp;A has a long association,
                    dating back to its foundation, of working with artists and
                    craftspeople, it is only within the last decade that this
                    latter group of visitors has been grouped together under a
                    particular label. Developing an agreed definition of the CI
                    as part of the visitor segmentation post-opening of the
                    British Galleries in 2001 had been somewhat of a struggle,
                    but by 2004 the Museum had a set of six audience
                    definitions, including one for the CI. However, this was an
                    ‘internal’ definition, so to speak, and during the last
                    decade the nature of the CI has become something debated far
                    wider than within the V&amp;A as an institution. The
                    introduction of the term ‘creative industries’ in government
                    language in the late 1990s was the beginning of an attempt
                    to bring unity to a fragmented selection of industries
                    identified as contributing significantly to the British
                    economy. Since then, there have been significant
                    developments in policy aimed at nurturing, benefiting from,
                    and ensuring the continued growth and success of, the
                    Creative Industries. Responsibility for this sector lies
                    nominally within the Department of Culture, Media and Sport
                    (DCMS), but both the Department for Skills and Education
                    (DfES)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn1" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI)<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn2" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    have launched initiatives and commissioned reports
                    investigating the growth of the creative industries sector.
                    The Cox Report, a review of creativity and design in UK
                    business, was published in December 2005.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn3" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    One of the objectives set out in the V&amp;A’s 2007–2012
                    Strategic Plan is, ‘to promote, support and develop the UK
                    creative economy by inspiring designers and makers and by
                    stimulating enjoyment and appreciation of design’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn4" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In response to this, and as part of a long-term programme to
                    revisit the definitions of its six visitor categories, in
                    2006 the Head of Gallery Interpretation, Evaluation and
                    Resources at the V&amp;A launched a research project aiming
                    to redefine the V&amp;A’s audience segmentation description
                    of the CI. After an initial literature review was conducted,
                    data was collected over the course of nine months and
                    consisted of three phases:

                    The findings from this research project were extensive and
                    complex. This short article will present one aspect only of
                    the findings, which is an exploration of the appropriateness
                    or otherwise of considering the CI in terms of a community
                    of practice. Within the terms of the research, it was
                    necessary to establish this before going on to consider the
                    findings in terms of the nature of the relationship between
                    the CI and the V&amp;A. These latter findings will be
                    presented in a further paper to be submitted to the V&amp;A
                    journal at a future date.
                  </p>
                  <h2>2&nbsp;Defining the Creative Industries</h2>
                  <p>
                    It was first necessary to identify current definitions for
                    the CI in a wider context external to the Museum. The
                    literature review looked at government publications and
                    reports related to the CI, and explored a number of agencies
                    and forums that have been set up to service the CI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were several findings with direct implications for
                    V&amp;A thinking about CI visitors. The first was that they
                    include those not actually involved in a creative occupation
                    themselves (e.g. an accountant at a design agency) and those
                    involved in a creative occupation but not actually working
                    in a creative industry (e.g. an in-house designer working
                    for a city firm). This type of definition dates back to
                    early thinking about the CI, such as the 1998 report
                    ‘Creative Britain’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn5" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second finding was the inclusion, by agencies such as
                    the Creative Industries Task Force,<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn6" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                    of industries where creative processes are utilised.
                    Therefore the CI in their broadest spectrum are considered
                    to consist not just of’core’ industries with obvious
                    creative output but also industries employing ‘creative
                    strategies’. These are termed ‘related’ industries and
                    activities and are included in all government strategies for
                    the CI. These first two findings can be said to form a
                    spectrum of ‘creative activity’ ranging across a variety of
                    type and depth of engagement with creative practice in
                    people’s work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The third significant finding was that, despite much
                    discussion about the potential educational and social
                    benefits to be gained from nurturing the CI in the UK,
                    ultimately economic benefit to the UK is the primary outcome
                    Government Departments responsible for CI initiatives are
                    interested in, as emphasised in the 2006 report by the
                    Entrepreneurship and Skills Task Group (ESTG).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn7" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>

                    Finally, and in notable contrast, it was found that that
                    many elements within the CI sector do not necessarily label
                    themselves as such. The literature review looked at current
                    magazines and journals associated with sectors identified
                    under CI, such as “Blueprint”, “Crafts”, “Design History
                    Newsletter” and “Frieze”, and found that there was little or
                    no reference to the CI. It also is worth noting that the
                    Office of National Statistics, in a recent publication of
                    figures of the UK workforce segmented by industry, does not
                    have a separate segment for the Creative Industries.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn8" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>

                    The broad ‘creative activity spectrum’ identified has
                    attendant issues for anyone interested in working with the
                    CI, and particularly for this research project, because of
                    the enormous variation of scope and activity within the unit
                    of study. This makes it a challenging sector in terms of
                    visitor profiling for the V&amp;A.

                  <h2>3&nbsp;Communities of Practice</h2>
                  <p>
                    Given the issues in defining the CI, the researchers used
                    Wenger and Lave’s ‘Communities of Practice’ methodology as a
                    framework to define the research.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn9" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                    ‘Communities of Practice’ is grounded in sociological theory
                    of practical knowledge, and pedagogical theories of situated
                    and social learning. It aims to identify groups of people
                    bound together through knowledge, and is based on a
                    definition of knowledge that includes tacit knowledge that
                    is shared informally through human interaction processes
                    such as storytelling, conversation and coaching or
                    mentoring. Their greatest value lies in intangible outcomes,
                    such as the relationships they build among people, the sense
                    of belonging they create, the spirit of inquiry they
                    generate, and the professional confidence and identity they
                    confer to their members.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn10" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, ‘Communities of Practice’ also acknowledges that
                    this shared knowledge is dynamic: constantly changed,
                    transformed and updated through these same processes.
                    Members spend little time on searching for solutions to
                    short-term problems because they can get access to help or
                    immediate solutions quickly through their community or
                    communities. Members are also more likely to take risks as
                    they feel they have back up and support from the community
                    of practice. This has the intangible outcome of a sense of
                    trust, which in turn has a tangible outcome of an increased
                    ability to innovate.

                  <p>
                    There are three indicators of structure for a community of
                    practice:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      A domain of knowledge with a defined set of issues, which
                      creates common ground and a sense of common identity. The
                      domain also inspires contribution and participation.
                      However, it requires participants to know its boundaries,
                      in order for members to be able to present ideas and
                      pursue common activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A community that creates a social context for learning.
                      The community interacts and fosters relationships based on
                      respect and trust. An effective community of practice
                      handles dissent productively. Members are able to share
                      ideas, expose ignorance and ask difficult questions. This
                      interaction fosters learning and also a sense of belonging
                      and commitment. However, members remain individual not
                      homogenous, and develop their own specialities and styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A practice consisting of a framework of shared ideas,
                      tools, information, language, stories and documents. This
                      forms the basic knowledge of the community that all
                      members share and from which development and innovation
                      can spring.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn11" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>

                    Exploring potential indicators of a domain indicating a
                    community of practice, the following shared issues were
                    found to be consistent within the CI:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>design challenge</strong>: pushing boundaries
                      in all areas of practice, e.g. working with new materials
                      such as casting glass in microwaves, ‘using new
                      technologies and integrating them into the craft process’
                      (Jeweller).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>business environment</strong>: participants
                      made very clear choices about assuring at least a base
                      level of income. This was perhaps not their ideal
                      practice, but freed them in their other time to follow
                      their own practice, as ‘the idea really is that we can say
                      no to jobs that we don’t want to do rather than just
                      having to take everything on’ (Architect); the practical
                      motivation for this work did not mean they would
                      compromise on quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Validation through
                      <strong>peer and commercial success</strong>. Participants
                      were very concerned about making the right product for the
                      right audience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Validation through <strong>‘client’ feedback</strong>.
                      This was particularly so at the initiator end of the
                      spectrum, as for example an auction house director felt
                      ‘well we are seeing it from the sales but we get good
                      feedback, we have had excellent feedback from things but
                      the great thing about (x) is that you can see whether
                      something is working, you can get a good feel for if
                      something’s working from the results of the sales’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Personal ambition</strong>: the need to constantly
                      push further. The jeweller disciplined herself to do one
                      collection per year&nbsp;during the summer to ‘prove to the
                      outside world that I can still do it’ (Jeweller).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Risk taking and innovation</strong>: a key
                      motivation and widely recognised indicator of creativity
                      across the spectrum, which encouraged innovation because
                      ‘you don’t hit brick walls because probably our sheer
                      audacity is doing something that people haven’t thought of
                      doing before’ (Publisher).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Enjoying <strong>problem solving</strong>, rather than
                      seeing problems as blocks to success. A jeweller highly
                      enjoyed and valued this, saying ‘it comes very naturally
                      to me, problem solving on the spot’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For a majority of makers, but significantly less so for
                      initiators, an <strong>academic research</strong> element
                      and formal education was integral to the domain. A
                      textiles designer particularly emphasised that ‘for me
                      educating is the consequence of the experience as a
                      designer and I think that if I stop designing … I’m not
                      saying that I won’t have stuff to give, but in a way that
                      was the process for how I came to education … I think it’s
                      a two-way flow and I think that has to keep going, if
                      you’re going to be effective’.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Quality control</strong>: performed informally
                      through peer-review and self-discipline.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The above are issues that work well as a shared domain
                    within the communities of practice framework, and during the
                    data collection, particularly in-depth interviews,
                    participants themselves also identified some of these
                    indicators as shared across different creative disciplines.
                    A publisher articulated this as being creative skill rather
                    than specifically discipline-related: ‘if you have the
                    medium then you apply that medium, that skill to whatever
                    you are supposed to be creating but the creation process I
                    think is equal across the board in the creative world’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This research found that nature of the CI domain, as
                    identified through the indicators described above, makes
                    this community of practice more than a set of relationships
                    and goes some way to giving it an agreed identity. This
                    identity fosters commitment to care for the domain, and
                    makes the CI a community of practice, more than a collection
                    of individuals with an informal communication network.
                    However, it was fragile and there was constant flux within
                    this domain. For some participants this was a source of
                    anxiety as well as challenge, because ‘it’s an industry that
                    changes constantly, it’s very easy to fall behind and not be
                    aware of current activities that are part of the working
                    environment’ (Textiles designer).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looking at the nature of the ‘community’ within the CI, this
                    research found that the network was primarily how people
                    across the entire spectrum tried out new
                    <strong>ideas</strong>, and tested them. A publisher
                    described ‘you know everybody comes up with bad ideas but
                    luckily there is a good filtering process. The more people
                    you talk to, you can weed all those out before they get any
                    further and cost a lot in development’. Within the
                    community, creativity itself was described predominantly in
                    terms of a <strong>process</strong>, that ‘creativity is the
                    thought process needed to produce or provide’ an identified
                    outcome (Jeweller). Notably, at the maker end of the
                    spectrum, people defined themselves as academics and had
                    planned to do so, as a jeweller recalled: ‘I had applied
                    also already for the RCA because I wanted to become a
                    teacher really, that was always my plan’. This was part of a
                    desire to pass on skills and intangible knowledge gathered
                    during <strong>experience</strong>, not just in terms of
                    creative skills but also business skills, considered vital:
                    ‘I wanted to feed that back, to channel it back in to
                    younger people to fast-track their experiences in a lot of
                    ways through the experience that I’d had and transmitting
                    those to someone, so that they didn’t have to go through the
                    same experience to an extent. That they could accumulate
                    that, based on someone else’s experience, that had gone
                    before’ (Textiles designer).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often, the aim of working in the CI was a vocation the
                    participant was aware of from an early age, for example a
                    theatre director who said ‘I have a feeling that I have been
                    working towards it all my life’. Surprisingly, being
                    creative was actually seen as only a small part of the
                    criteria for professional success. However, it was the
                    kernel that made all the difference to their enjoyment of
                    work, as ‘it’s the idea to go back and be able to talk about
                    ideas and spend hours in a whole day talking to people about
                    ideas and process and values and that’s a great luxury’
                    (Architect). It is this luxury that allowed participants to
                    <strong>innovate</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mentors played an important role, even during relatively
                    unfocussed times of early professional development. This
                    ranged from sensing a feeling of empathy with like-minded
                    people, to meeting someone particularly inspiring and
                    nurturing. A publisher described: ‘I was picked up by a
                    brilliant Dutch designer from Pentagram. He liked my
                    attitude, I think it was very similar to his and really he
                    gave me an apprenticeship which I am so grateful for’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, <strong>collaboration</strong> with others was
                    critical as a way of participants finding their path in the
                    community. Across the data, people described themselves as
                    part of a chain within which they maintained their
                    individual aspect.

                    The community factor within a community of practice should
                    be essentially a network of relationships that allows
                    exchange of ideas and risk-taking within a safe,
                    non-judgemental environment. The network of relationships in
                    the CI found amongst participants was based on five common
                    elements:
                    <strong>ideas, process, experience, innovation, and
                      collaboration</strong>. This gives confidence to its members. Members are able to
                    take risks and expose themselves to failure because there is
                    no ‘hierarchy’ within the community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research found that the community network is well
                    established within individual disciplines, but less so
                    across the whole Creative Activity Spectrum. The shared
                    issues identified above are not specific enough to coalesce
                    to form a domain that works across differing disciplines
                    within the community. The lack of these defined boundaries,
                    affecting the community network, is possibly an issue that
                    contributes to a lack of self-identification of the CI with
                    the UK Government concept of CI.

                  <p>
                    ‘Practice’, the third indicator of a community of practice,
                    was important for the CI across the spectrum. It was the
                    area where the research identified the most unifying
                    factors, for example the huge proportion of participants who
                    read The&nbsp;Guardian (82.9% of on-line participants). Within
                    practice, the notion of a spectrum of process and practice
                    came through strongly. However, it was also where the most
                    complex debate around the nature of creativity itself
                    occurred. Many participants spent a long time in discussion
                    through the various data collection methods considering
                    creativity, but one jeweller summarised the open-ended
                    nature of the debate by saying ‘creativity is easy to
                    assume, but not so to define. The concept is wide open
                    depending on its context and it would be unwise to be so
                    reductive’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An issue that came up many times was the importance not just
                    of design and practical skills, but also of understanding
                    how to negotiate the field. The need to ‘understand the
                    professional, the profession and your role within the
                    profession’ (Textiles designer) was critical to people’s
                    sense of professional identity. A significant skill was the
                    ability to see a concept through to production, requiring
                    project management and people skills. Being able to foster
                    and maintain an original concept through this was seen to be
                    the ultimate in definitions of creativity. ‘For it [the
                    final output] to resemble what you had in mind in the first
                    place is another great leap’ (Architect).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was reflected in the workplaces that were visited as
                    part of the ethnographic data collection. For the most part
                    open plan, sometimes with specific work areas allocated to
                    tasks rather than specific people, all were extremely well
                    organised and had areas where the ‘bones’ of projects being
                    worked on were exposed. For example, the textiles designer
                    was very clear about separation between what he called ‘the
                    workplace’, which is the commercial production environment
                    for textiles, and the ‘educational environment’ which is for
                    teaching, even though physically there may not have been a
                    difference to the untutored eye. All participants talked
                    about cycles of working practice they had developed to
                    ensure multiple project management. An auction house
                    Director described himself almost as the eye of the storm:
                    ‘My job is to make sure that it all comes together in a
                    timely fashion and I also work to pull the images together
                    so I can let all these people know, certainly from the
                    creative side of things’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants felt that their chosen area of design was a
                    matter of application rather than vocation, although working
                    generally in the CI field was a vocation. A ceramicist
                    described herself as a visual artist who predominantly works
                    in clay; a textiles designer had started off training as a
                    ceramicist. This was not just a matter of the type of output
                    but applying creativity across a whole range of skills, as a
                    theatre director described: ‘certainly I would advocate that
                    now people are much more, you know you’re not trained just
                    to be an actress, just to be this, just to be that, and that
                    there is something creative entrepreneur, cultural
                    entrepreneur, a real subject … you have a much broader view
                    of what you could do’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Participants were not necessarily specifically formally
                    trained but nearly all mentioned informal continuing
                    development (90.8% of on-line participants). Notably, at the
                    maker end of the creative activity spectrum, participants
                    had been engaging with their creative practice from a very
                    early age. By the time they were ‘mid-career’ professionals
                    they could easily have been working in various creative
                    disciplines for twenty-five years. This meant that students
                    were already viewed as professionals even by their tutors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Collaboration in the community was about working as an
                    individual within a collective, with ‘like-minded people’
                    rather than in the same discipline. The need to retain
                    individuality was directly related to professional ego, as a
                    textiles designer described: ‘I’m happy to work like that in
                    my own design field and then go out and discuss but actually
                    the design process is a quite personal one’. However, in
                    contrast to feelings about collaboration, ambition and
                    self-promotion came through strongly in terms of
                    self-discipline. This combination of seemingly conflicting
                    factors resulted in a key indicator of the CI community of
                    practice, which was that all the participants were very
                    adept at analysing their own strengths and weaknesses and
                    using collaboration to address them. They were therefore
                    good at finding people with the right skills and knowledge
                    to help them achieve the ‘vision’ of their practice. A
                    publisher described using his network for this: ‘I like
                    people who come up and can be incredibly resourceful, can
                    realise something while still being really resourceful and
                    that is why I like to employ people with a lot of contacts
                    who have worked in and around the creative field’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It seemed that the primary shared feature of practice was
                    the interest in process rather than product. Whilst people
                    were interested in following their own practice, and
                    organised their work commercially to enable that, they also
                    liked competitions, which they felt set boundaries that
                    challenged their practice and therefore produced better
                    work.

                  <h2>5&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    This research showed that the Creative Industries closely
                    resemble a community of practice. A notion of a spectrum of
                    creative activity from initiators to makers emerged, and
                    elements within the domain, community and practice varied
                    slightly according to where participants sat on the
                    spectrum. Across the whole spectrum, but noticeably with
                    makers, the idea of creative industry was seen as something
                    applicable across many disciplines. There was very strong
                    self-identification for makers from an early age, which was
                    not necessarily related to the stage of formal training they
                    may have participated in. This was in part because
                    creativity was seen much more as a process than a product,
                    but also because people were very aware of their own
                    strengths and weaknesses, and viewed collaboration as key to
                    addressing them. This was balanced with an awareness of
                    their own individual skill and unique selling points.
                    Informal recommendation and word of mouth led to the most
                    successful collaboration. Contrary to a generalised view of
                    people who are ‘creative’, commercial success was more
                    important than commonly assumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The creative activity spectrum identified in the research
                    can be thought of as relating to the intellectual property
                    of creative process, as well as to creative production.
                    Significantly, the former can happen without a notably
                    ‘creative’ output, but with a notably creative outcome,
                    which is what the DCMS was particularly interested in
                    cultivating to encourage economic success.

                    According to Wenger, the most successful communities of
                    practice thrive where the goals and needs of an organisation
                    intersect with the passions and aspirations of participants.
                    If the domain of a community fails to inspire its members,
                    the community will flounder.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-communities-of-practice-fn12" id="page-communities-of-practice-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>
                    However, in this case the domain of shared issues was the
                    weakest of the three indicators. The community was strong
                    but with fuzzy boundaries, and the practice was most
                    defined. For the V&amp;A, this means that it is extremely
                    challenging to nurture a relationship between the CI and the
                    Museum which both contributes to V&amp;A objectives and
                    could also be proven to contribute to Government objectives.
                    Furthermore, and most challenging for the V&amp;A, is the
                    great difference between Government thinking about the CI
                    and thinking within those industries themselves. However,
                    the benefits of the V&amp;A considering the CI as a
                    community of practice is in the potential the Museum could
                    have to contribute not only to the knowledge management of
                    the CI, the domain, but also to the practice that applies to
                    this knowledge management.

                  <p>
                    Arts and Humanities research directly informs the key
                    activities of a national museum like the Victoria and Albert
                    Museum (V&amp;A). The Museum serves as an international
                    centre of excellence in the fields of the history of art and
                    design, conservation, learning and interpretation and
                    contemporary creative practice, and its programmes benefit
                    from research that is designed to contribute both to the
                    public understanding and experience of its collections, and
                    to the methodological and theoretical advancement of
                    relevant arts and humanities disciplines. The V&amp;A
                    therefore fosters a proactive research culture, both in
                    developing public outcomes that are underpinned by current
                    scholarship (its galleries, high-profile exhibitions,
                    publications, conferences and website) and in fostering
                    collaborations with academic partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a frequent recipient of Arts and Humanities Research
                    Council and other research grants the V&amp;A is well
                    practiced in recognising and capitalising on opportunities
                    to enhance the value of its activities and outputs through
                    ambitious, authoritative and accessible research programmes.
                    This essay will discuss recent examples of externally-funded
                    projects at the V&amp;A where innovative object,
                    collections, exhibitions and archive-based research has made
                    a demonstrable and positive impact on both specialist
                    knowledge and the quality of the visitor experience,
                    stimulating debate on past and present cultures, and
                    encouraging new approaches to scholarship and the
                    dissemination of expertise in the UK and beyond.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much recent debate on the value of the public arts sector
                    (including museums and galleries) has focused on its
                    measurable contribution to the national economy via the
                    creative industries, tourism and a vibrant art market, and
                    to the quality of life of individuals and communities. It is
                    certainly the case that the UK’s museums play an important
                    role in raising social capital, encouraging inclusion and
                    kick-starting urban regeneration. Less has been said
                    however, on the ways in which the practice of Arts and
                    Humanities research underpins these initiatives,
                    particularly in the context of the museum exhibition and
                    display. The following case-studies demonstrate the
                    significant impact that such research activities can make
                    via the public presentation of the nation’s material and
                    cultural assets.
                  </p>
                  <h3>i. Object-led research</h3>
                  <p>
                    The most distinctive feature of museum-based research is
                    that it is based on objects. Prompted by artefacts from the
                    past, museums have traditionally tended to ask very focused
                    questions about dating, authorship, manufacture, and usage.
                    While this approach was once seen as conservative by
                    academics, in recent years the idea that objects should be
                    given priority – that they should determine the course of
                    research, rather than serving as data – has become more and
                    more accepted. Indeed, many observers agree that there has
                    been a ‘material turn’ in fields such as anthropology,
                    social history, and even literary studies, comparable to the
                    much-discussed ‘linguistic turn’ that occurred in the
                    humanities some thirty years ago. The shift towards
                    materiality has encouraged museum professionals and academic
                    researchers to work together more closely than ever before,
                    particularly in the UK. This has been beneficial to all
                    concerned. UK-based museum curators have broadened the range
                    of questions that they ask of their collections, and the
                    focus on objects has similarly transformed the methods and
                    goals of scholarly research and learning in the British
                    higher education sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are multiple advantages to be gained by placing
                    objects at the centre of a collaborative research project,
                    rather than in the margins. First and foremost, artefacts
                    exert friction on the researcher. General theories are
                    invariably tested by the specificity and concreteness of
                    objects, which rarely conform to expectation. Partly for
                    this reason, object-led research is fundamentally
                    interdisciplinary. Fully accounting for the research
                    potential of even a single object might require
                    contributions by historians of art, culture, science, and
                    economics as well as specialists in conservation and other
                    scientific disciplines.

                  <p>
                    Take, for example, the decorated beer mug inscribed ‘1701’.
                    Such an object can be studied, first of all, on the basis of
                    its appearance. Its somewhat old-fashioned decoration in
                    slip (liquid clay) attests to stylistic conservatism in
                    Staffordshire, the place of its manufacture. Yet if we
                    inquire further, we might find that the mug was implicated
                    in new networks of distribution. The materials used to make
                    it may have been sourced from far away, and the finished
                    object sold in a distant city, or even abroad in America and
                    Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We might ask where and how the mug was used. Through the
                    comparative study of objects like this one we can learn
                    about communal drinking habits, the emergence of new venues
                    for socialization, and attitudes towards intoxication. Or we
                    might wonder about the significance of its date inscription,
                    which would lead to questions about attitudes to marriage,
                    childbirth, or political commemoration. The mug would
                    probably have been used across a broad spectrum of society,
                    from the ‘plainer sorts’ to the upwardly mobile mercantile
                    class. This is a further advantage of object-led research:
                    it often yields evidence of a wider demographic range than
                    textual sources do. In periods where many people were
                    illiterate or semi-literate, or where documents are scarce,
                    objects can often be the only means of accessing the
                    experience of the majority of people – people whose
                    descendants now form a core audience for museum displays and
                    popular histories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite all these benefits, object-based research also poses
                    its own challenges. First and foremost, though museum
                    collections are often defined by the goal of preservation,
                    researchers are forced to think about the objects they hold
                    as dynamic. Unlike most textual forms of historic evidence,
                    material things are subject to constant change through
                    modification, wear and repair. Though authenticity and
                    originality are prized, the fact is that when it comes to
                    objects from the past, alteration is the norm, not the
                    exception.

                    Museum-based conservation offers a disciplinary basis for
                    research into such issues. The techniques of the scientist
                    and the conservator can be used to gain access not only to
                    the moment of an object’s creation, but also its entire
                    lifespan: a principle that lies at the heart of the
                    V&amp;A’s recent research project focusing on the Mazarin
                    Chest (funded by the Getty Foundation and the Toshiba
                    International Foundation, supported by the Japan Foundation
                    and the Tobunken, and carried out at the V&amp;A, Imperial
                    College, Loughborough University, Dresden Academy of Fine
                    Arts and the Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry,
                    Polish Academy of Sciences). The chest is a most unusual
                    example of seventeenth-century Japanese lacquerwork, of a
                    very high quality that would normally not have been exported
                    to Europe. Its history of ownership permits us to see it in
                    relation to a long series of people and places – from its
                    Japanese makers to its initial owners, the Mazarin family of
                    France, from the Romantic-era collector William Beckford, to
                    the V&amp;A itself (the museum acquired the object in 1882).

                    The Mazarin Chest project also shed light on differing
                    cultural attitudes to historic objects in the present day.
                    The goal was to develop an integrated approach to the
                    conservation of lacquer objects that respects both western
                    conservation ethics, in which concern with the
                    re-treatability of objects is paramount, and Japanese
                    conservation values, which seek to preserve the cultural
                    continuity of objects by employing, as far as possible,
                    materials and techniques similar to those used at the time
                    of manufacture. The chest has thus been a basis not only for
                    nuanced historic research but also new international
                    exchanges of knowledge and understanding.

                    A final advantage of object-led research is its direct
                    connection to physical experience. Every researcher who has
                    worked in a museum knows that handling unfamiliar objects
                    for the first time is among the most thrilling aspects of
                    their work. This excitement is telling us something: through
                    touch, we can begin to ask new questions about those
                    different from ourselves. For those interested in issues
                    such as comportment, the senses, and sexual and ethnic
                    identity, materiality can provide routes into unspoken (and
                    perhaps even unconscious) cultural values. Fashion – a
                    subject to which we will return – is a particularly obvious
                    example. Thinking about the self-regulating function of
                    garments, from the kimono to the corset, is an instance in
                    which research can make the lived experience of cultural
                    difference immediately palpable to all.

                  <h3>ii. Collections-based research</h3>
                  <p>
                    Like the objects which form their content, permanent
                    collections such as those housed at the V&amp;A are not
                    inert. They are a live inheritance that requires constant
                    re-interpretation and new models of communication if they
                    are to speak effectively to contemporary audiences and
                    enhance our sense of the complex, globalised
                    twenty-first-century world as an entity with historical
                    roots and challenging futures. Research is one of the
                    methods by which we realise the social and cultural value of
                    the assets that museums hold on behalf of the public, an
                    obvious point but one that is too rarely made in press
                    coverage and reviews of headline exhibitions and gallery
                    developments. Two current research projects help to
                    elucidate the relevance of our material heritage as
                    represented in the Museum’s collections to the diverse
                    communities of the UK.

                    ‘Fashioning Diaspora Space’ is a three-year collaboration
                    between the V&amp;A and Royal Holloway University of London.
                    It is funded by the AHRC as part of the ‘Diasporas,
                    Identities and Migration’ Programme and examines the
                    presence in the UK of South Asian (Indian and Pakistani)
                    textiles intended for use in clothing. In the context of the
                    Museum, the project is expanding knowledge about the
                    V&amp;A’s collections of nineteenth-century Indian textiles,
                    not only in terms of identifying the objects, but also
                    through asking how and why these collections were formed,
                    how they have been used in the past and what they might mean
                    to current and future generations of curators, visitors,
                    designers and consumers. This research is also relevant to
                    the holdings of other museum collections from the City Art
                    Galleries and Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, Paisley
                    Museum and Bath Fashion Museum, to the archives of past and
                    present textile manufacturers at Macclesfield Silk Archives,
                    Warners and J&amp;P Baker, as well as to the work of
                    contemporary fashion retailers.In comparing colonial and
                    postcolonial forms, untangling their genesis, their cultural
                    designations and translations, the project has significant
                    implications for our understanding of wider British material
                    and visual cultures and landscapes.

                    One of the earliest groups within the Indian textile
                    collections at the V&amp;A consists of examples acquired at
                    the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was the first time that
                    large numbers of the British public had seen what Indian
                    textile producers were capable of. The quality of Indian
                    hand woven silk, embroideries and muslins was unmatched by
                    industrial British textile manufacturers. In the 1860s and
                    70s many of the South Asian textiles in the collection were
                    cut up and put into two multi-volume sets of textile sample
                    books. These were sent around the country to both inspire
                    designers and manufacturers, and with a view to building up
                    the sales of British textiles to the Indian
                    subcontinent.Forthcoming entries on the V&amp;A website (the
                    non-destructive equivalent of these nineteenth-century
                    albums)about South Asian textiles in the Museum will make
                    relevant images and information on their history, context
                    and use universally available to a UK (and international)
                    audience for the first time since the middle of the
                    nineteenth century.

                    The story of the V&amp;A’s South Asian textile collection is
                    typical of diaspora narratives, in its mixture of emulation,
                    destruction, and learning. These processes – both positive
                    and negative – are to be found in many other instances of
                    cultural exchange, international trade and migration. Indian
                    textiles, too, include vivid examples of objects whose very
                    surfaces play out the action of far-flung networks in their
                    materials and decoration. The investigation of a distinctive
                    Parsi Chinese embroidery consisting of a coloured embroidery
                    on white silk depicting birds among foliage shaped for a
                    jubla or girl’s shirt reveals longer histories and
                    connections. The Parsis of Bombay (Mumbai) were descendants
                    of the Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent
                    from Iran in the eighth century. Parsi-owned shipping
                    companies traded with China, returning with highly prized
                    Chinese goods including embroidered textiles. Some Chinese
                    embroiderers also settled in Surat, a port city in
                    Gujarat.This single jubla is thus the complex result of the
                    interwoven histories of four nations in two continents
                    spanning twelve centuries. New interpretations fostered
                    through the focused research of such an object (amongst many
                    others) indicate that it is time to move beyond postcolonial
                    hand wringing and progress in our understanding of a shared
                    human past.

                  <p>
                    A second example focuses on an aspect of the Museum’s
                    practices where research has revealed a previously
                    overlooked area of the V&amp;A’s collecting history. The
                    thirty-month-long project, conducted as part of a Cultural
                    Ownership and Capacity Building Project and supported by the
                    Heritage Lottery Fund focuses on identifying and
                    interpreting Africa-related materials within the
                    collections. The undertaking builds on several years of
                    engagement with Black British communities, seeking to build
                    Black and Minority Ethnic audiences for the V&amp;A and to
                    develop collaborations and skill-sharing within the Black
                    heritage/culturalsector.

                  <p>
                    The V&amp;A has always collected the art and design of
                    Africa. Initially, its collecting focused on the northern
                    part of the continent. Thirteen Tunisian textiles were part
                    of the 1851 Great Exhibition purchases which formed the core
                    of the collection. Ancient Egyptian textiles and glassware
                    and Moroccan and Algerian ceramics and jewellery formed
                    other collecting strands through the second half of the
                    nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. This
                    same period witnessed a number of key imperial acquisitions
                    from sub-Saharan Africa including religious, ceremonial and
                    decorative items associated with Ethiopia’s ruling family
                    acquired through the Abyssinian Expedition of 1868, and
                    thirteen pieces of largely gold regalia, probably associated
                    with the court of the Asante leader, acquired through the
                    British invasion of Kumasi, state capital of Asante, Ghana,
                    in 1874.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently, these African acquisitions have been
                    supplemented with objects that reflect the changing
                    political, social and cultural contexts of ‘postcolonial’
                    Africa. The Word and Image Department has been particularly
                    active, acquiring prints by African artists including Ben
                    Enwonwu, Tunde Odunlade, Paul Sibisi and David Koloane. The
                    cultural influence of the African diaspora is also
                    represented in acquisitions of work by Caribbean artists
                    such as Winston Branch and Aubrey Williams and Black British
                    artists such as Maud Sulter, Lubaina Himid, Chris Ofili and
                    Faisal Abdu’Allah. It is hoped that this fresh,
                    research-informed awareness may fuel revisions to the
                    Museum’s collecting policy and encourage a more proactive,
                    creative approach to its Africa collections and their future
                    development.

                  <h3>iii. Exhibitions</h3>
                  <p>
                    Placed at the crossroads between scholarly enquiry and
                    communication with a wider audience, exhibitions are ideally
                    located to disseminatethe broad cultural, social and
                    economic benefits associated with the arts and humanities
                    field, positively engaging visitors in a much more direct
                    and immersive manner than other forms of media. Unlike other
                    academic outputs, exhibitions must confront the demands of
                    appealing to very large non-specialist audiences while
                    making specialist knowledge widely accessible. This unique
                    set of circumstances makes exhibitions a particularly
                    challenging and stimulating arena within which to explore
                    the value and impact of research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, exhibition-based research within the UK has
                    changed dramatically in character and scope. Museums have
                    been at the heart of a momentous cultural shift which has
                    transformed them from perceived passive recipients of
                    research-led initiatives to frontrunners. Fostered by an
                    increasing number of national and international research
                    funding schemes and policies designed to generate active
                    collaborations between museums, universities and colleges,
                    this radical transformation raises important questions about
                    the new character and purpose of exhibition-based research.
                    This is the framework within which the groundbreaking
                    exhibition ‘At Home in Renaissance Italy’ (V&amp;A, October
                    2006 – January 2007) – the result of a four-year research
                    project funded by the Getty Foundation and the AHRC
                    -&nbsp;operated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research leading to an exhibition differs substantially
                    from conventional academic research. Centred on ‘things’,
                    the research process must acknowledge that objects are
                    carriers of complex visual, material, cultural and social
                    meanings and that as such they should generate multiple
                    narratives and interpretations. This recognition often
                    demands breaking out of traditional disciplinary boundaries
                    and embracing an interdisciplinary outlook. The research for
                    ‘At Home in Renaissance Italy’ was carried out by a
                    multi-disciplinary team including scholars working within
                    art, decorative arts and architectural history, social
                    history, Islamic studies, music history, archaeology, the
                    history of science, food history and conservation. Exploring
                    the domestic interior in Italy between 1400 and 1600 in all
                    its visual and material complexity, with objects ranging
                    from prestigious old master paintings and sculpture to pins
                    and pastry cutters, the exhibition brought together for the
                    first time the world of Renaissance ‘high’ art and that of
                    domestic material culture. Engaging with household life and
                    everyday experience as well as cultural forms, the
                    exhibition addressed topics as wide ranging as cooking and
                    dining, marriage and childbirth rituals, gambling,
                    music-making, health and hygiene, collecting and
                    mathematical knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project aimed to make a major new contribution to
                    Renaissance studies and to give revived meaning to the
                    outstanding Renaissance collections housed within the
                    V&amp;A.To achieve these objectives the project maximized
                    its investment in original research by focusing on a wide
                    variety of largely unpublished written documents, visual
                    sources and objects. From domestic inventories to cookery
                    books, from celebrated family portraits to popular prints,
                    from ancient gems to chamber pots, the exhibition revealed a
                    new, multi-faceted aspect to Renaissance art and culture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The multiplicity of research methods and exhibits involved
                    in the project was reflected in the narratives accompanying
                    the display, based directly on primary sources, which
                    suggested different, often contrasting interpretations of
                    the same objects. Replacing the traditional authoritative
                    curatorial voice with a more challenging and active
                    approach, this mode of display aimed at including the viewer
                    creatively in the meaning-making process and encouraging a
                    dialogue between specialists and a wider audience.This
                    curatorial strategy meant that there was a direct continuity
                    from the initial framing of research questions all the way
                    to the labels read by members of the public.

                    Much recent debate has highlighted the widespread
                    dissatisfaction with traditional arenas of social and
                    cultural exchange and the need for alternative spaces for
                    public discourse. As public events and experiences playing a
                    role in the creation of shared meaning, exhibitions can be
                    seen as a largely untapped force for debate and social
                    cohesion. Exhibitions such as ‘At Home in Renaissance Italy’
                    can respond to this demand for public engagement with
                    culture in different ways. By presenting historical
                    materials in an exciting and accessible form they can help
                    to bridge the gap between past and present. By revealing
                    everyday objects, stories or situations that resonate with
                    the life experience of the viewer they can appeal to wider
                    cross-sections of society. By addressing complexity and
                    difference head-on, challenging commonly held assumptions
                    and establishing a dynamic relationship with the viewer,
                    they can provide potent evidence of the value of investing
                    in research into the arts and the humanities.

                  <h3>iv. Creativity and design practice</h3>
                  <p>
                    Museum-based arts and humanities research also capitalises
                    on and creates multiple connections within the creative
                    industries, making links between practitioners including
                    fine artists, graphic, fashion and 3D designers and
                    craftspeople; manufacturers; scientists; retailers;
                    educators; journalists, publishers and media producers. It
                    encourages debate and collaboration across discrete sectors
                    to their collective benefit and offers an inspirational
                    space in which national conversations about creative skills
                    can take place. In the case of the V&amp;A, research
                    projects focusing on fashion have been particularly
                    successful in generating productive dialogue about this
                    high-profile, multi-million pound industry and its economic,
                    cultural and political meanings and impact.

                    The ‘Shopping Routes: Networks of Fashion Consumption in
                    London’s West End 1945 – 1979’ project was one such
                    initiative. Jointly hosted by the Geography Department at
                    Royal Holloway, University of London, London College of
                    Fashion and the V&amp;A between 2003 and 2006 as part of the
                    ESRC/AHRCCultures of Consumption Programme, the project had
                    the central aim of providing a new critical history of the
                    development of the West End in the post-war period; widening
                    and complicating existing assumptions, particularly those
                    associated with the powerful myth of ‘Swinging London.’ The
                    project had a series of focused research objectives, seeking
                    to provide an account of the interfaces between designers,
                    manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, urban planners and
                    consumers in the city. It also sought to develop recent
                    ideas about the spatial contexts of fashion consumption,
                    especially those situated in major metropolises, and to
                    enhance understandings of consumption-led processes of urban
                    renewal and transformation. It had the wider aim of
                    interpreting London’s role as a major fashion city in a
                    comparative context, by examining the development of a range
                    of key global sites of fashion consumption within a longer
                    time-frame.

                    Through a combination of cross-institutional and
                    multi-disciplinary approaches, the research succeeded in
                    providing a much more nuanced and extensive history of a
                    phenomenon that hitherto has generally been approached
                    through nostalgic accounts that focused on over-familiar
                    sites like Carnaby Street and the King’s Road, and on the
                    emergent celebrity culture of the 1960s. It achieved this in
                    a number of ways. First, archival research pointed to the
                    significance of long-term features of London’s fashion
                    landscape, situating the seemingly overnight transformation
                    of the city in the mid-1960s in the context of existing
                    structures of retailing, wholesale, promotion and consumer
                    behaviour, some of which had their roots in the
                    mid-nineteenth century. Secondly, it challenged the existing
                    emphasis on individual designers and boutiques, in favour of
                    a framework that emphasised networks and relationships
                    across sectors and traditions, and identified fashion
                    consumption’s interactions with other elements of urban
                    change, particularly in architecture, planning and heritage.
                    Thirdly, the project provided a systematic study of the
                    concept of the ‘Fashion World City’, placing the specific
                    characteristics of post-war London in a wider analysis of
                    fashion’s relationship with metropolitan modernity, that
                    continues to have important resonance in the present.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The results of the research were disseminated through a
                    number of channels including books and journal articles. The
                    study of fashion in world cities formed the basis for a
                    major international conference that brought together
                    academics from a wide range of disciplines, and included
                    studies of New York, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Moscow, Los
                    Angeles, Shanghai and Mumbai to complement the London focus.
                    Most importantly, in 2006 the project was responsible for a
                    high-profile exhibition on ‘Sixties Fashion’ and an
                    associated website at the V&amp;A. This provided an
                    opportunity to test some of the research findings through an
                    engagement with the Museum’s collections, and through
                    collaboration with designers, journalists and retailers
                    active through the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Both display and
                    website, together with an exhibition book, were designed to
                    reach a broad audience and had a demonstrable effect on the
                    popular imagination, drawing positive press comment and
                    informing the content of the UK school curriculum. The
                    website also provided a way of soliciting memories of the
                    period from the public, and a means of disseminating oral
                    history interviews with key designers, entrepreneurs,
                    journalists and others involved in 1960s London.

                  <p>
                    In general, the project has formed part of a wider
                    re-evaluation of the political, economic and creative legacy
                    of the 1960s that has taken place in UK academic circles and
                    in the popular mediaduring the past two decades. But besides
                    providing an important platform for debate on these
                    retrospective issues, ‘Shopping Routes’, particularly in its
                    work on fashion and the concept of the World City, also
                    engaged with wider discussion on contemporary urban policy
                    in relation to what has been termed the New Urban Cultural
                    Economy. What this museum-centered research initiative has
                    identified is the extent to which the drive towards symbolic
                    distinctiveness by competing fashion cities needs to be
                    considered alongside the contradictory forces that stifle
                    urban individuality and creativity. These forces include the
                    hyper-capitalisation of property markets and the increasing
                    power of global corporations in a hugely expanded luxury
                    goods sector.History does have something to teach us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the content of the ‘Sixties Fashion’ exhibition
                    suggested, connections between the new symbolic industries
                    (media and advertising) and older craft traditions were much
                    more dynamic in cities like London, New York, Milan and
                    Paris in the 1950s and 1960s, than they were after the
                    massive de-industrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. The
                    creative networks, flexible production and vibrant consumer
                    cultures of then have been replaced by the corporatised
                    surface sheen of now. So, though ‘Swinging London’ was a
                    small, local affair, its openings for new businesses, its
                    legacy of traditional fashion skills, its affordable
                    infrastructure and its innovative approach to consumerism
                    offers a genuinely distinctive template to those concerned
                    about the serious challenges faced by UK fashion
                    entrepreneurs in the globalised landscape of the early
                    twenty-first century.

                  <h3>v. The museum as a forum for cultural exchange</h3>
                  <p>
                    Besides functioning as platforms for creative reflection and
                    innovation in relation to the UK’s history and current
                    cultural and economic status, museums are also ideal venues
                    for the staging of new cultural interactions beyond national
                    frontiers. As we have suggested in reference to projects on
                    Japan, South Asia and Africa, because objects themselves
                    have always traversed national boundaries they are therefore
                    a remarkably effective way of studying historical and
                    contemporary cultural exchange. Through intelligent
                    juxtaposition, museums can encourage researchers, curators
                    and the public alike to see both difference and continuity
                    across diverse nationalities, ethnicities, and geographies.
                    This has long been a guiding principle of research at the
                    V&amp;A, and informs permanent displays such as the British
                    Galleries (opened 2001), the Jameel Gallery for Islamic Arts
                    (opened 2006), and the new Ceramics Galleries (to open
                    2009).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research for two exhibitions, on view this year at the
                    V&amp;A, exemplify this approach. ‘Cold War Modern’ (opened
                    in the Autumn of 2008 and researched in collaboration with
                    colleagues at the University of Brighton and the Royal
                    College of Art) uses the museum platform to reconfigure
                    understandings of international relations in the recent past
                    through the prism of design. Concentrating on the highly
                    volatile years from 1945 to 1975, the exhibition will
                    examine the key themes of the period including the task of
                    reconstruction in Europe after the War and the rise of
                    consumerism, demonstrating a continuity with the themes of
                    Modernism as they emerged in the inter-war years (explored
                    in the V&amp;A’s ‘Modernism: Designing a New World’
                    exhibition of 2006). The strong influence of the Cold War
                    upon popular culture will be shown through graphics,
                    fashion, film, and product design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than focusing exclusively on the two superpowers that
                    formed the poles of Cold War politics (the USA and USSR),
                    the exhibition looks at countries such as Italy, France,
                    Poland and Czechoslovakia, all of which were shaped by the
                    era’s politics but were not necessarily able to dictate
                    them. The recovery of design history from these contexts
                    unveils complex lines of stylistic and technological
                    exchange. The Soviet satellites of the Eastern Bloc, for
                    example, experimented with surprising intersections between
                    modernism and ideology. Across the project’s wide geography,
                    art and design during this period played a central role in
                    representing, and sometimes challenging, the dominant ideas
                    of the age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘China Design Now’, on view at the V&amp;A during the Spring
                    of 2008, was an even more clear-cut example of the Museum as
                    a forum for cultural debate and exchange and a vehicle for
                    truly original research. Based on extensive curatorial
                    field-work carried out in Shenzhen, Shanghai and&nbsp;Beijing
                    over a period of four years, and a three-day research
                    workshop held at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing
                    in 2006, the exhibition provided a snapshot of the last ten
                    years of rapid change in China’s creative industries.
                    Despite considerable recent media coverage in the UK (partly
                    due to the upcoming Olympics in Beijing), public
                    understanding of the social and industrial transformations
                    occurring in China is only just starting to take shape. In
                    such a moment there is no substitute for on-the-ground
                    research, and this the V&amp;A has been able to provide
                    in-depth, bringing examples of product, fashion,
                    architectural and graphic design before the British public
                    for the first time. In addition, ‘China Design Now’ offered
                    insights into the dynamics of emergent design
                    professionalism – and thus offers lessons that might well be
                    applied to the study of other places and times.

                  <h2>Concluding comments</h2>
                  <p>
                    These various case studies demonstrate the vibrancy of arts
                    and humanities research undertaken within just one national
                    institution; many othersimilar examples could be cited from
                    the activities of the V&amp;A, and more broadly across the
                    British museum and gallery sector. What positions
                    inter-disciplinary museum-based research in the UK as unique
                    is its innovative focus on material and visual culture as a
                    primary focus for explaining broader cultural, aesthetic,
                    economic and political developments; its openness to
                    cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary research as a
                    means of formulating such explanations; and its
                    extraordinary capacity to further specialist knowledge
                    whilst also informing wider public understanding. There is
                    of course much potential for strengthening the research-base
                    of the UK’s museum sector, not least through further
                    research that demonstrates the essential link between
                    grounded, scholarly investigation of collections and the
                    experience of the visitor. All must agree however, that the
                    simplistic dismissal of museum outputs as ‘dumbed-down’
                    versions of academic research – spectacular but empty
                    entertainment – overlooks the tremendous innovation that
                    underlies museum work in the UK today. This research
                    constitutes an example to our international peers, and a
                    major contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of
                    the nation.

                    The Oliver Messel Collection consists of around 10,000
                    individual items and has been housed by the V&amp;A Theatre
                    Collections since 1981. The collection was originally on
                    loan from Lord Snowdon, Messel’s nephew, who inherited the
                    collection on his uncle’s death in 1978. In 1983 the V&amp;A
                    held a major exhibition using the Messel collection as the
                    source material and including many objects on loan from his
                    family, friends and work colleagues, including his sister
                    Anne (Lady Rosse) and his nephew, Thomas Messel.

                    Friends of the V&amp;A and the National Art Collections
                    Fund, the V&amp;A Theatre Collections purchased the
                    collection from Lord Snowdon. Under the funding agreement,
                    the V&amp;A established a touring interactive display using
                    the collection as an inspiration. The Museum also staged a
                    conference held at the Theatre Museum where V&amp;A curators
                    and Messel’s nephew, Thomas, gave papers on Messel’s legacy
                    as an interior, film and stage designer.

                  <h2>Oliver Messel (1904 – 1978)</h2>
                  <p>
                    <strong>‘I attempted to use every device to make as much magic as
                      possible’. Oliver Messel.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-oliver-messel-fn1" id="page-oliver-messel-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Oliver Messel was the leading British stage designer of the
                    mid-twentieth century. He was born on 13 January 1904 to
                    Maud Frances (1875 – 1960) (daughter of the Punch cartoonist
                    Edward Linley Sambourne (1844 – 1953) and Lieutenant-Colonel
                    Leonard Charles Rudolph Messel (1872 – 1953), a successful
                    banker. Messel began his fifty-year career in 1925 and won
                    international acclaim for his exquisite taste and mastery of
                    period style in revues, plays, films, interiors, buildings,
                    musicals, operas and ballets, becoming one of the most
                    sought-after and highly-paid scenery and costume designers
                    of his era.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messel was a master of illusion and make-believe; from his
                    early childhood he made model houses, furniture and painted
                    maquettes. He could make a chandelier out of sticky paper
                    and fuse-wire, or construct a dancer’s head-dress out of
                    pipe cleaners. His nephew, Lord Snowdon, remembers as a
                    child finding a bird’s nest in his London garden and on
                    inspection discovering that it had been made by his uncle
                    Oliver, and that the eggs were made of hand-painted china.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messel was a perfectionist who knew exactly how fabric
                    should be cut and how every stage prop should be made. He
                    often demanded items be remade if they were not to his
                    satisfaction. He worked with every major theatre director of
                    his generation and received a CBE in 1958. He designed nine
                    films throughout his career, each displaying his intrinsic
                    knowledge and research for period detail and his flair for
                    creative inventiveness.

                    <p>
                      ‘Oliver made a white dress for me with a blue sash worn
                      like a halter, which he made from a wonderful material
                      called lisse, which is finer than organza. He had a sharp
                      eye for what you were and never overdressed me. He made me
                      look like a million dollars’. Eyelyn Laye**<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-oliver-messel-fn2" id="page-oliver-messel-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>**

                  <p>
                    Messel had trained as a painter at the Slade School of Art
                    where his contemporaries included Rex Whistler (1905 –
                    1944). His formal studies concentrated on life drawing and
                    painting, but he also made masks from papier-mâché and wax
                    for student events. An exhibition of his masks at the
                    Claridge Galleries in London in 1925 led to his first stage
                    commission to design masks for the prestigious Diaghilev
                    ballet production of Zéphyre et Flore, performed at the
                    London Coliseum. From 1926 onwards, Charles B. Cochran
                    engaged Messel to design costumes, masks and sets for his
                    annual reviews at the London Pavilion. These reviews
                    consisted of songs, sketches and chorus numbers, and
                    provided Messel with ample opportunities to develop and
                    exercise his talent for minute attention to detail,
                    inventive use of materials and imaginative pastiche of
                    historical periods and styles. This would become Messel’s
                    trademark in whatever medium he worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1932, Messel’s white-on-white set and costume designs for
                    Helen, an opera bouffe with music by Jacques Offenbach,
                    directed by Max Reinhardt, caused a sensation on the London
                    stage. The production cemented his success and secured a
                    steady stream of prestigious London theatre design
                    commissions from the 1930s to the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was Messel’s work on Helen and the 1932 production of Max
                    Reinhardt’s wordless medieval play The Miracle that brought
                    him to the attention of film director and producer,
                    Alexander Korda. Korda was founder of London Films and
                    Denham Film studios in Buckinghamshire. He was a figurehead
                    in the fledgling British film industry and was the first
                    film director to be knighted. Messel’s first film for Korda
                    was The Private Life of Don Juan, which starred Douglas
                    Fairbanks. It was during Messel’s second film for Korda, The
                    Scarlet Pimpernel, starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon,
                    that Messel really explored the pastiching of a historical
                    period – in this case the late eighteenth century. Messel
                    was hired especially to design costumes for Oberon, who
                    would later become Korda’s wife. The film is a romantic
                    adventure set during the French Revolution with a supporting
                    cast including Raymond Massey and Nigel Bruce. The costumes
                    for Oberon were daringly low-cut but very flattering. Messel
                    used picture hats to frame Oberon’s dark features. They were
                    fanciful and fairylike versions of the Regency period style
                    of dress and this approach to designing and creating
                    costumes would become Messel’s own distinctive style over
                    the next thirty years.

                  <h2>Romeo and Juliet (1936)</h2>
                  <p>
                    Messel’s next film project took him to Hollywood and gave
                    him the resources of a major film studio with which to
                    realise his designs in a historical film. In 1935, the
                    Hollywood film studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer was planning a
                    production of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Irving
                    Thalberg was Head of Production at MGM and wanted a high
                    profile production for his wife, Norma Shearer, who had been
                    off the screen for a year, having given birth to their
                    second child. Shearer was one of the most popular stars at
                    MGM during the 1930s and she had first choice of any major
                    film the studio was planning to produce. Irving, along with
                    Chief Executive Louis B. Mayer, had established MGM as the
                    most powerful film studio in the world with the famous tag
                    line ‘more stars than there are in heaven’. The studio was
                    synonymous with lavish glossy musicals, drawing-room
                    comedies and high quality literary adaptations. For
                    Shearer’s return to the screen, two high profile historical
                    projects were considered: Romeo and Juliet and Marie
                    Antoinette. Louis B. Mayer, felt the ‘masses’ were not ready
                    for Shakespeare, but script problems on Marie Antoinette
                    delayed the production so Romeo and Juliet was given the
                    green light with a budget of $1,000, 000 dollars. In 1935,
                    this was the most expensive MGM production to date. George
                    Cukor, who had recently scored a hit with a screen version
                    of David Copperfield, was hired to direct.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cukor was keen for a fresh look for the film, setting it in
                    mid-Renaissance Italy. Having seen Messel’s work for The
                    Miracle in New York, he arranged for screenings of The
                    Scarlet Pimpernel and The Private Life of Don Juan for
                    Irving Thalberg and Norma Shearer. Cukor felt Messel’s
                    costumes for Merle Oberon were ornate but casual and
                    captured the essence of the period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As well as actors, writers and directors, MGM had two of the
                    most creative individuals in the history of the Hollywood
                    studio system under contract, Cedric Gibbons and Gilbert
                    Adrian (often credited on films as ‘Gowns by Adrian’). As
                    Head of the Art Department, Cedric Gibbons was known for his
                    Art Deco-styled set designs; his loathing of wallpapered
                    sets gave MGM productions a distinct, modern, unfussy ‘house
                    style’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-oliver-messel-fn3" id="page-oliver-messel-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    Gibbons stipulated in his contract a clause that his name
                    was put to every MGM production, regardless of whether he
                    designed it or not. Messel’s arrival from England to design
                    the film caused some initial tension at the studio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once Messel was formally engaged on the production, he was
                    dispatched with a camera crew to Italy where he spent three
                    months recording almost 3,000 photos of buildings, squares,
                    balconies, paintings, frescos and drawings. He studied the
                    paintings of Botticelli, Bellini, Carpaccio, Ghirlandaio and
                    Piero della Francesca. Gozzoli’s painting Procession of the
                    Magi, was used as an inspiration to fashion all the costumes
                    for the entrance of the Prince of Verona and his followers
                    at the beginning of the film. Norma Shearer’s costumes were
                    inspired by Fra Angelico’s painting The Annunciation and her
                    ball gown was adapted from Michele da Veronay’s The
                    Betrothal. The level of research undertaken by Messel for
                    the film is evident in the collection held at the V&amp;A,
                    with hundreds of photographs detailing every aspect of
                    Italian imagery that would inspire the design for the film.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once back in Hollywood, Messel discovered that the studio’s
                    principal costume designer, Gilbert Adrian, had already
                    designed all the costumes, but used his charm to complete
                    what he had been hired to do. The costumes in the finished
                    film can be matched with the costume designs that are held
                    in the archive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The shoot lasted 108 days and the set covered five acres of
                    sound stages. The set department created a near
                    reconstruction of Piazza San Zeno in Verona. Romeo and
                    Juliet was one of the most intricate costuming operations in
                    MGM’s history, with more than 1,200 costumes produced for
                    the film on which 500 people worked for two months. Several
                    looms were set up in Los Angeles and two mills were engaged
                    in New York to weave tights all in one piece. A total of
                    18,000 yards of cotton, silk, satin, velvet and wool went
                    into the costumes for the extras employed to portray crowds
                    of townspeople, soldiers and nobles. One of Leslie Howard’s
                    cloaks for Romeo used nine yards of Fortuny cloth imported
                    from Italy. Norma Shearer’s costumes required one hundred
                    yards of assorted silks, satins and other materials, all
                    hand-embroidered or beaded to reproduce, as closely as
                    possible, the embroidery of the time. The ‘Juliet skull cap’
                    worn by Norma Shearer was a fashion hit with audiences of
                    the period. During his stay in Hollywood, Messel discovered
                    Dozian’s, a shop in Los Angeles that sold, in his words,
                    ‘every kind of material ever made’. He bought yards of
                    unpatterned fabric, which was then hand-painted and stitched
                    in the MGM workrooms.

                  <p>
                    The famous balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet was reshot
                    three times at Thalberg’s insistence (he watched the daily
                    rushes of all the films he supervised at MGM) in close-up,
                    medium and long shot and the set occupied 52,000 square feet
                    of sound stage. Many of Messel’s characteristic design
                    motifs that he would use throughout his career are visually
                    evident in the film: in the Capulets’ ball scene, for
                    example, where Romeo first spots Juliet, ornate flowered
                    garlands hang around the high arched walls.

                    Norma Shearer employed the English theatre actress Constance
                    Collier on the set to coach her verse delivery. Shearer, not
                    a trained actress, was extremely nervous of taking on such a
                    classical role. Her anxiety, however, was compensated with
                    generally good reviews for her performance and an Academy
                    Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was also
                    nominated in the following categories: Best Supporting Actor
                    (Basil Rathbone), Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons) and Best
                    Film (Irving Thalberg). Nevertheless, Romeo and Juliet made
                    a loss at the box office, although the studio felt that
                    films of this quality added to MGM’s prestige. Producer
                    Irving Thalberg died ten days after the Los Angeles premiere
                    of Romeo and Juliet; he was thirty-seven years old.

                    Watching the film today, the sets alternate between Messel’s
                    romantic interiors and Gibbons’s solid, geometric rooms, and
                    the film generally lacks a certain passion, with the emotion
                    of many scenes underplayed. This is possibly due to the
                    period in which it was conceived. Later in his film career,
                    George Cukor stated that out of all his films, this was one
                    to which he would have liked to return.

                    In 1944, Messel began work on a film version of George
                    Bernard Shaw’s stage play Caesar and Cleopatra. The
                    production was directed by Gabriel Pascal, who became the
                    only director trusted by Shaw to film his plays after
                    successful film versions of Pygmalion in 1938 and Major
                    Barbara in 1941.

                    The film starred Claude Rains as Caesar, Vivien Leigh as
                    Cleopatra, Stewart Granger as Apollodorus and a host of
                    strong English character actors in supporting roles. The
                    production was filmed in Technicolor, and remains the only
                    full production designed by Messel that displays his design
                    work in colour.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-oliver-messel-fn5" id="page-oliver-messel-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    He was engaged to design costumes, props and interior
                    decoration (sets for the film were by John Bryan) and in
                    this production his talent and skill for creating objects
                    from everyday items and transforming them into something
                    ‘real’ for the screen displays his versatility and
                    creativeness.

                    During the Second World War, Messel had been stationed in
                    Norwich as Camouflage Officer and it was Messel’s experience
                    of designing camouflage which would be used again in
                    designing Caesar and Cleopatra. Under the conditions of
                    wartime Britain, with strict rationing in place and many
                    shops closing down, materials required for the film were not
                    readily available. Therefore, Messel had to extend the ‘make
                    do and mend’ ethos of wartime Britain into the film’s
                    design. Many of the props required had to be created using
                    what was freely available. Authentic-looking antique
                    Egyptian jewelry was created from thin wire, plastic,
                    cellophane and bits of glass. Gold plates and ornaments were
                    made from a combination of gilded leather and papier-mâché.
                    Many of the costumes were contrived from Indian saris,
                    obtained from some of the large department stores in London
                    which where still functioning. Costume-making workshops were
                    also badly understaffed due to the essential dressmaking
                    workforce having left London due to bombing or on war
                    service.

                    Interiors, decorative hangings and bedspreads were printed
                    in hand-blocked Egyptian and Persian designs, curtains of
                    coupon-free gauze were stencilled with authentic patterns of
                    the period in specially mixed dyes. Messel’s assistants on
                    the film included Eleanor Abbey, Margaret Furse, Beatrice
                    Dawson, Arthur Boys and Matilda Etches, and the small
                    production team worked extremely long hours to sew
                    individual replica jewels onto the costumes. Messel designed
                    the fringed bed hangings in Cleopatra’s bedroom. For the
                    feathered fans used by Cleopatra’s handmaidens in the music
                    room scene, he borrowed some of the large fans from the
                    Messel family home, Nymans, in Sussex (these are now in the
                    Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).

                    Messel’s assistants were adept interpreters of Messel’s

                    many headdresses for the ballerina Margot Fonteyn, also
                    worked on the headdresses required. Materials used on one of
                    the wigs for Vivien Leigh as Cleopatra include leather, wax,
                    wire, acetate, glass, beads and paint. Finally, over 2,000
                    costumes were created for the production.

                    Caesar and Cleopatra was shot under extremely difficult
                    conditions, beginning on 12 June 1944, six days after the
                    D-Day landings. The director Gabriel Pascal wrote to George
                    Bernard Shaw on 22 June 1944 and told him:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Last Saturday, I had a narrow escape on the Pharos set
                    which is built out of doors on the studio lot, when a flying
                    bomb landed and exploded 150 yards from the set in a nearby
                    field. Last night the French windows in my sitting-room were

                    Shaw took a keen interest on almost every level of the film,
                    down to the smallest detail. Below is a sample of
                    correspondence between the two during the film:

                    <strong>1 July 1944</strong> : George Bernard Shaw wrote to
                    Gabriel Pascal about one of the characters costumes:<br>
                    ‘Britannus is so hopelessly wrong that he will hold up all
                    the scenes in which he appears until he is redressed. I
                    enclose a suggestion of what he should look like. He must
                    have an academic gown.’

                    <strong>8 July 1944</strong> : Pascal to Shaw:&nbsp;<br>
                    ‘I have discarded the original costume and have had a long
                    gown made for him. His wig I have had remade with red hair,
                    as you suggest, and a new moustache, turning down.’

                    <strong>9 July 1944</strong> : Shaw to Pascal:&nbsp;<br>
                    ‘Britannus’s must be mainly in blue, the shepherd’s plaid is
                    only for the tunic, that is why the blue overall should be
                    an academic gown, opening all at the front [sic]. They have
                    plenty of things in Oxford still.’

                  <p>
                    <strong>23 July 1944</strong> : Pascal to Shaw:&nbsp;<br>
                    ‘I made a new costume, a new wig, and a new moustache for
                    Britannus and am sending you photos of his costume and
                    make-up. The costume is now a lovely cornflower blue.’

                  <p>
                    <strong>26 July 1944</strong> : Shaw to Pascal:&nbsp;<br>
                    ‘Brittanus’s costume is alright now but his moustache is
                    hopeless. He must have Dundreary whiskers – yellow

                    The sets for the film which complemented Messel’s interior
                    decoration and costumes were by John Bryan, who had designed
                    Pygmalion and Major Barbara. The ancient Memphis Palace, to
                    which Cleopatra brings Caesar after their encounter at the
                    Sphinx, was the largest interior created for the film. It
                    occupied 28, 000 square feet of floor space and each of its
                    pseudo-granite columns measured nineteen feet in diameter.

                  <p>
                    A twenty-seven-foot-high mini-Sphinx was created for the
                    film, and when the crew moved to Egypt for exterior shots,
                    the Sphinx was dismantled and shipped over. Once filming was
                    completed the Sphinx was left in the desert to save money on
                    transportation, where it became a photographic background

                    The final cost of Caesar and Cleopatra was £1.3 million, the

                    inventiveness, working under extraordinarily difficult
                    circumstances and the ability of his team of makers and

                    The film version of Alexander Pushkin’s
                    <em>The Queen of Spades</em> is one in a long line of
                    classic British supernatural thrillers such as
                    <em>Dead of Night</em> (1945) and
                    <em>The Innocents</em> (1961). The story is set in 1806 in
                    St Petersburg and is a Faustian tale of bargains with the
                    devil and ghostly apparitions. The film was directed by
                    Thorold Dickinson, who took over the production at only
                    three days notice. Messel was hired to design the sets and
                    costumes.

                    From the outset the production was fraught with difficulties
                    and it was not until the film was completed that it emerged
                    as one of Dickinson’s finest films, with Messel’s
                    contribution to the work helping to create one of the most
                    famous British supernatural-themed films of the 1940s.

                    The production was filmed at Welwyn Garden City, in
                    out-of-date, cramped and badly soundproofed studios. They
                    were situated next to the main railway line so that shooting
                    had to be halted every time a train passed by. The lack of
                    space added to Messel’s headaches but he insisted on
                    designing and building the Countess’s stage coach to full
                    size and not to scale so that it could not be moved more
                    than ten feet in either direction.

                  <p>
                    The budget ran out before the film was completed and
                    Dickinson was forced to improvise with some sets which were
                    constantly being torn down and replaced with new ones. In
                    addition, he was working with two performers who had never
                    made films before, Edith Evans and Yvonne Mitchell (although
                    Edith Evans had made a number of silent films, it was her
                    first ‘talking’ picture). They both found it difficult to
                    adjust to the demands of the camera after their experience
                    on the stage. Edith Evans for example, had been advised by
                    Alec Guiness to let the camera do all the work and so she
                    underplayed drastically and had to be coaxed into expanding
                    her performance. Yvonne Mitchell tended to give her best
                    performance during the first take and found herself unable
                    to repeat her initial performance in subsequent takes. The
                    script underwent numerous changes throughout the production;
                    the original prologue of the film became a flashback, and
                    sequences were cut or transposed, frequently being shot with
                    no real idea of what order they would finally appear in.
                    Under these conditions Dickinson rose to the challenge and
                    was spurred on in inventing visual techniques to drive the
                    story forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dickinson created a number of superb sequences in which he
                    uses suggestion to create terror. The visit of the young
                    Countess to the palace of St Germain is worthy of the great
                    English horror director James Whale (Frankenstein, The Bride
                    of Frankenstein). Once at the palace, the camera follows the
                    Countess down the cobwebbed corridor until she comes to a
                    huge door, which opens to reveal a gaping blackness beyond.
                    Messel’s set design for this sequence created the suggestive
                    and eerie atmosphere that Dickinson was able to replicate on
                    film.

                    The lighting of the film adds considerably to the
                    atmosphere. It was predominantly low-key, creating some
                    striking chiaroscuro effects, and brilliantly captures the
                    Messel interiors.The cinematographer was Otto Heller, whose
                    films included <em>The Ladykillers</em> (1955),
                    <em>Peeping Tom</em> (1960) and <em>Victim</em> (1961).
                    Heller used a series of wide-angle lenses to suggest space
                    and width where they did not exist, particularly in a key
                    ballroom scene, where camera trickery was used to deceive
                    the eye. The vertiginous high-angle shot of the young
                    Countess’s arrival at the palace of St Germain was created
                    because they could not afford to build the palace façade.
                    Instead, they created the effect by putting up a corner of a
                    wall with a gargoyle on it, directing lights to give the
                    appearance of an open door and then shooting down onto the
                    carriage. Point-of-view shots were used constantly to
                    disguise the fact that many sets were either small or
                    half-built, or in some cases non-existent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dickinson often used shots of visual symbolism, common in
                    the silent film era and used by Alfred Hitchcock in almost
                    all of his films. One such key moment is when the Countess,
                    now armed with the secret of the cards, goes to the gambling
                    house. As she flings her crucifix onto a transparent glass
                    table so that it dominates the frame, Dickinson places the
                    camera underneath the table focusing not only on the
                    crucifix being used as a gambling tool, but the ceiling
                    above her head which depicts two huge claws that will now
                    symbolically consume her soul for the remainder of the film.

                    Mirrors are a recurring motif in the film: characters look
                    at themselves at crucial points and their actions are also
                    frequently seen reflected in mirrors. Such devices provide a
                    visual unity to the film which plays creatively off the
                    sets, the movement of the camera and angle of the
                    camerawork.

                    The scope of Messel’s design in the film is apparent from
                    the set and costume designs held in the V&amp;A collection.
                    Every prop and period detail had been researched
                    meticulously and parts of the set design had a twist. Scenes
                    in the palace of the old Countess had to look as if they had
                    remained unchanged for fifty years. The gilded, rococo
                    elaboration of her state apartments had to appear mellowed
                    under dust and patina; the vaulted hallway and great
                    staircases within her palace also had to strike a sombre
                    note. The squalor of the serfs had to be represented as did
                    many exteriors, including a bird market and a carriage
                    crossing a bridge, which were all filmed indoors.

                    When the film opened in June 1949, it received universal
                    praise from the critics. Dilys Powell wrote in The Sunday

                    A young Ken Adam was a production draughtsman on the film.
                    He would go on to design many of the James Bond films,
                    <em>Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang</em> (1968) and
                    <em>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and
                      Love the Bomb</em>

                    At the end of 1950 The Royal Opera House in London presented
                    its first ever production of Tchaikovsky’s
                    <em>The Queen of Spades</em>, directed by Michael Benthall.
                    As Messel had designed the film, he was the obvious choice
                    for the opera version. For the most significant scene, when
                    the Countess dies, Messel created a masterly conception: he
                    placed her in a giant armchair creating the illusion of her
                    shrunken image.

                    Messel’s last film was based on Tennessee Williams’s stage
                    play <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em>. The film was directed
                    by Joseph L. Mankiewicz from a screenplay by Gore Vidal with
                    an all-star cast in the leading roles – Katharine Hepburn,
                    Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor. Filmed in Shepperton
                    Studios near London, Messel’s sub- tropical deep-south
                    jungle set for Mrs Venables’ house, with its larger than
                    life exotic garden containing huge and menacing plants, was
                    reminiscent in style of his exterior stage settings for The
                    Little Hut, Ring Round the Moon and The House of Flowers.
                    The garden became the main set piece where many key scenes
                    take place, creating an essentially claustrophobic and
                    over-powering presence in the film.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messel’s research into capturing the New Orleans French
                    Quarter atmosphere was as extensive as always. Images of
                    buildings, balconies, squares, gates, and, for the
                    extraordinary garden, photographs of prehistoric forests and
                    plants, are all contained in the V&amp;A collection.Messel
                    once again engaged Hugh Skillan to assist him on the film.
                    Skillan had worked with Messel since 1942; his headdresses
                    were so light and excellent in construction that artists
                    found them comfortable to wear. Skillan worked on making the
                    insect-eating plants and out-sized exotic foliage. Messel
                    made banana leaves with waxed crinkle paper and then mixed
                    them with real plants; he also made vines from paper twisted
                    round in coils and then covered with pale green flock. Over
                    seventy different varieties of plants were used on the set
                    and mixed with a painted backdrop; the effect was that of a
                    monstrous jungle.

                    In one scene which takes place in Sebastian’s studio, Messel
                    has placed masks from his 1920s reviews on the desk and on
                    the walls. Among the set designs for Suddenly, Last Summer
                    are more mundane sketches and ground plans for corridors,
                    offices for the hospital in which Elizabeth Taylor’s
                    character is being held and exteriors for the fictional
                    location, Cabeza de Lobo. The extraordinary baroque lift in
                    which Katharine Hepburn descends for her first entrance was
                    created with John Claridge, who assisted Messel on many
                    projects including the Dorchester Hotel suite created in
                    1953.

                    Winning Messel an Academy Award nomination for set and
                    costumes design, <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> would be his
                    last film. His successful working relationship with
                    Elizabeth Taylor led Twentieth Century Fox to commission him
                    to design her costumes and wigs for their forthcoming
                    mammoth production of <em>Cleopatra</em>, but this had an
                    unhappy end for Messel because his designs were never used
                    and he was replaced on the production by Irene Sharaff who
                    would win an Academy Award for her work.

                    In the mid-1960s, Messel moved to Barbados and began
                    designing homes there and for the adjacent island, Mustique
                    (including a villa for HRH The Princess Margaret). His work
                    as an architect would again reflect his inventive use of
                    materials: for his own house he made use of local coral
                    stone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messel’s creative ingenuity was evident throughout his
                    career in whatever medium he worked. For students of art,
                    design, performance and film, access to this unique
                    collection at the V&amp;A and the availability of his film
                    work on DVD gives new insight into the working practices and
                    techniques of one of Britain’s most talented and
                    accomplished stage designers.

                          At the beginning of 1939, Messel co-designed costumes
                          for the Alexander Korda epic
                          <em>The Thief of Baghdad</em> (the other two costume

                          Vertes). It was Britain’s first Technicolor film and
                          won Academy Awards for Special Effects, Art Direction

                    There is a longstanding affiliation between confinement and
                    creativity. While restricting the movement of the human
                    form, prisons, workhouses, internment camps, hospitals and
                    asylums have long been the site of great imagination and
                    industry. Nineteenth-century Parisian prisons promoted
                    furniture-making, while in the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth century, British officials in India installed
                    looms in several prisons to produce carpets and
                    textiles.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn1" id="page-patchwork-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    In 2010 a V&amp;A exhibition will place examples of over 300
                    years of British quilting and patchwork within their
                    historical and social contexts. It will include the 1841
                    ‘Rajah Quilt’, the only known transportation quilt in a
                    public collection, and a newly commissioned collaboration
                    with the charity Fine Cell Work, designed and made by the
                    inmates of HMP Wandsworth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the objects in the exhibition will provide evidence
                    of the ways in which individual makers have responded to
                    their environment, not least in the case of those makers who
                    are working within the unique surroundings of the prison.
                    This paper will focus on the particular work of Elizabeth
                    Fry as a prison reformer in the nineteenth century, her
                    connection to the Rajah Quilt, and offer a consideration of
                    the HMP Wandsworth commission in the light of this history.

                  <h2>Elizabeth Fry and the British prison system</h2>
                  <p>
                    The use of confinement as a punishment for crime is a
                    relatively new concept, and one closely tied to the
                    transportation of convicted felons: a process that started
                    in the eighteenth century and continued for over 200
                    years.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn2" id="page-patchwork-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    The largest movements were to America in the eighteenth
                    century, and then to Australia in the nineteenth
                    century.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn3" id="page-patchwork-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    Although the actual punishment was a term of hard labour,
                    many of the earliest prisons were developed as collection
                    points for those awaiting trial or transportation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn4" id="page-patchwork-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                    In these early prisons, no distinctions were made between
                    prisoners who might be awaiting trial, debtors, and
                    convicted felons. Furthermore, there was no classification
                    of prisoners based on sex or age.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn5" id="page-patchwork-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    Conditions were summarised by the reformer John Howard in
                    ‘The State of the Prisons in England and Wales’ as ‘filthy,
                    corrupt-ridden and unhealthy’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn6" id="page-patchwork-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the first three decades of the nineteenth
                    century, Britain witnessed the growth of reformatory theory
                    as a basis for prison discipline, and an increasing interest
                    in rehabilitation initiatives.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn7" id="page-patchwork-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    Texts on the subject of prison reform circulated within
                    society, many of which were characterised by both moral
                    fervour and first-hand accounts of prison conditions.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn8" id="page-patchwork-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                    In particular, the reformer Elizabeth Fry started to stress
                    the humanitarian needs and rehabilitative potential of
                    prisoners, propagating the benefits of social mobility and
                    improvement in the wake of years of punishment and
                    retribution. Fry was born in Norwich on 21 May 1780. She was
                    raised in a Quaker household, and became a minister and
                    preacher for the Society of Friends in 1810. Her interest in
                    prison conditions began after visiting Newgate Prison in
                    1813 and witnessing the living conditions of women and
                    children.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn9" id="page-patchwork-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    Fry’s particular focus was the improvement of conditions for
                    women inmates. Her reform methods involved the establishment
                    of several ladies committees: small groups of women who
                    visited prisons on a regular basis to work directly with
                    inmates, often taking food and clothing with them, but
                    predominantly offering teaching and guidance. In 1821 Fry
                    formed the British Ladies Society for the Reformation of
                    Female Prisoners, which formalised the opportunity for women
                    outside the prison to identify with members of their own sex
                    and offer aid and instruction where possible.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn10" id="page-patchwork-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    The women of the Ladies Society donated sewing supplies
                    which included tape, ten yards of fabric, four balls of
                    white cotton sewing thread, a ball each of black, red and
                    blue thread, black wool, twenty-four hanks of coloured
                    thread, a thimble, one hundred needles, threads, pins,
                    scissors and two pounds of patchwork pieces (or almost ten
                    metres of fabric).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn11" id="page-patchwork-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    Fry’s jurisdiction aimed to replace the primacy of
                    punishment, violence and repression used to regulate social
                    relationships with a pastoral model encouraging education
                    and rehabilitation, affiliation and empathy:<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn12" id="page-patchwork-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>

                    These comments respect a community consciousness shared
                    between women at various levels of society. Fry’s subsequent
                    observations emphasise the importance of providing adequate
                    education and instruction during a period of incarceration,
                    in the understanding that this would lead to a pattern of
                    behaviour desirable during social reintegration. Annemieke
                    van Drenth and Francisca de Haan have suggested that this
                    aspect of Fry’s work can be seen as a secularised variation
                    of the pastoral care developed in the traditions of
                    Christianity and Quakerism.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn14" id="page-patchwork-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>
                    Adopting a stricter form of Quakerism in 1799, Fry’s
                    fundamental belief was that divine revelation was immediate
                    and individual, terming such revelation the ‘inward light’
                    or the ‘inner light’. Fry’s Quakerism rejected a formal
                    creed and stressed inward contemplation as the route to
                    salvation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn15" id="page-patchwork-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;Needlework can be seen as a tool which offered not only a
                    practical skill, but also an enlightened state of
                    contemplation, whereby the focus required for the act of
                    stitching would have allowed the maker to enter a mental
                    space removed from the everyday.

                    There are numerous objects in public collections that
                    testify to the therapeutic value attached to the needle, but
                    less research has been carried out on the particular choice
                    of patchwork as a tool of reform.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn16" id="page-patchwork-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    Fry herself was keen to highlight patchwork as an excellent
                    choice for the women of Newgate:

                  <blockquote>

                      ‘Formerly, patchwork occupied much of the time of the
                      women confined to Newgate, as it still does that of the
                      female convicts on the voyage to New South Wales. It is an
                      exceptional mode of employing the women, if no other work
                      can be procured for them, and is useful as a means for
                      teaching them the art of sewing.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn17" id="page-patchwork-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Fry draws a subtle distinction here between patchwork and
                    other forms of needlework. While patchwork is useful as an
                    instructional tool (something that the sampler excelled at),
                    it is exceptional in employing and occupying the women. The
                    creation of intricate patchwork required a heavy investment
                    of time. With a lack of active employment, the experience of
                    prison life for many in the early nineteenth century was
                    reduced to the soul-destroying slippage of hours into days.
                    Fry was keen to instil in the prisoner the transformative
                    potential of this experience, turning simply ‘doing time’
                    into the positive experience of having the time in which to
                    do something, and restoring a sense of control and
                    independence to the inmate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Integral to the success of Fry’s scheme was attaching value
                    to this time spent: the union of a creative agenda with
                    financial remuneration for the ‘industries’ carried out by
                    the female inmates. These plans were initially resisted:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      ‘Objections have been made, by some persons, to the
                      employment of prisoners, on the ground that it may be the
                      means of depriving some of the industrious poor of the
                      means of an honest and respectable maintenance.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn18" id="page-patchwork-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup></strong>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    However, Fry sought to persuade prison authorities of the
                    motivational benefits of paid employment.
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      ‘It is to be hoped, however, that such objections will,
                      ere long, cease to be urged; for it is abundantly evident,
                      that unless the time of these poor females, who have
                      abandoned themselves to idleness and vice, be fully
                      occupied while they are in prison, there can be little or
                      no hope that their confinement will lead to their
                      reformation. Without this important aid to prison
                      discipline, their attention will still be directed to the
                      criminal objects which have previously occupied them, and
                      much of their time will probably be spent in contriving
                      plans for future evil. We cannot promote the reformation
                      of such persons more effectively than by making them
                      experimentally acquainted with the fruits of industry …
                      Some remuneration for their work, even during their
                      continuance in confinement, will be found to act as a
                      powerful stimulus to a powerful and persevering
                      industry.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn19" id="page-patchwork-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup></strong>

                    Fry’s appeal was successful, and set a precedent for
                    contemporary needlework initiatives.

                    Fry was not alone in advocating the necessity of financial
                    remuneration for those who took up needlework within the
                    prison. John Francis Maguire was the Mayor of Cork in 1852.

                    year, and the successful display of several prison quilts\
                    he published a text which aimed to highlight ‘the advantages
                    of industrial employment in public institutions, especially
                    those intended for purposes of reformation’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn20" id="page-patchwork-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup></strong>

                      solicitude of the chaplains, it very rarely happened that
                      any unhappy creature out of the many thousands committed

                    While a ‘select few’ of the prison population were employed
                    in ‘industrial occupation’ (making clothes and carrying out
                    some daily prison duties), it was not until 1847 that a
                    stronger campaign for rehabilitation was put into place:

                    The emphasis here is on active employment, aimed to improve
                    the inmate’s well-being, social interaction within the
                    prison, and the likelihood of rehabilitation upon release.
                    Maguire highlights the potential of the prison to act as an
                    educational and reformatory institution, propagating a
                    familiarity with the production of goods and the world of
                    trade. The eventual display of the Cork Gaol quilts in the
                    National Exhibition of 1852 implies that Maguire was
                    effective in engaging the inmates with the wider industrial
                    economy (and the associated principles of spectacle,
                    commerce and display), despite their confinement. His
                    terminology of redemption and elevation is also reflective
                    of Fry’s socio-religious discourse, suggesting mental focus
                    as the routes to salvation. These approaches stress the
                    prison as a rehabilitative rather than punitive environment,
                    forwarding the needle as one of the primary tools of utility
                    and reform.

                    Fry’s extensive accounts and diaries offer an insight into
                    the use of needlework in prisons in the nineteenth century,
                    but today there is relatively little testimony available
                    from the convicts with whom she worked. Often this
                    information is bound up in the objects that the prisoners
                    created. One such object is the only known transportation
                    quilt in a public collection; the Rajah Quilt.

                    In 1841, patchwork provisions were carried on board the
                    Rajah, to be used by some of the 180 women prisoners on
                    board. The ship left Woolwich on 5th April and arrived in
                    Hobart, Van Diemen’s Land (present day Tasmania) on 19th
                    July with 179 women prisoners, and it is thought that up to
                    twenty-nine convict women may have worked the quilt.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn25" id="page-patchwork-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup></strong>

                    Australia, who believe that it may have been produced under
                    the guidance of Miss Keiza Hayter.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn26" id="page-patchwork-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup></strong>
                    Hayter had worked at the Millbank Penitentiary, and was
                    given free passage on board in the understanding that she
                    dedicated her time to the improvement of the prisoners. On
                    the recommendation of Fry, Hayter joined the journey to Van
                    Diemen’s Land to assist Lady Franklin in the formation of
                    the Tasmanian Ladies’ Society for the Reformation of Female
                    Prisoners.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn27" id="page-patchwork-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup></strong>
                    The message inscribed on the quilt suggests that Hayter may
                    have continued the educational practices of the Ladies
                    Society,

                    The quilt suggests a desire to enter into the processes of
                    creation and renewal beyond the instructive space of the
                    prison, while also paying homage to the patronage of the
                    Ladies Committee. The quilt was intended to travel back to
                    Britain as a gift, documenting the safe passage of both the
                    female convicts and Fry’s message to the shores of Van
                    Diemen’s Land. Whether or not Fry saw it before her death is
                    unknown, but it also spoke to a wider audience about the
                    ‘fruits of industry’, claiming the relevance of Fry’s
                    message beyond the walls of Newgate.

                    The quilt measures 325 × 337 centimetres. It is designed
                    with a central square of Broderie Perse (appliquéd chintz),
                    with twelve frames radiating outwards to form a medallion
                    quilt (a patchwork quilt with a central panel framed by
                    multiple borders).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Broderie Perse coverlets seem to have been particularly
                    popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.
                    Two examples are now held by the V&amp;A, and are thought to
                    date from the first half of the nineteenth century. The
                    first (V&amp;A museum no: T.382-1960) is a white cotton
                    coverlet, appliquéd with block-printed chintzes. The central
                    panel contains a peacock, and the frame surrounding this is
                    divided into smaller square compartments containing flowers,
                    Chinese vases and other Chinoiserie motifs (such as birds,
                    trees and small figures in Chinese dress). The outer border
                    of the quilt has a bright red ground printed in black with a
                    classical design of urns, and an eagle and lyre design. Work
                    undertaken at the Museum by Barbara Morris at the time of
                    acquisition dates the textiles, many of which were printed
                    at Bannister Hall near Preston, to between 1804 and 1811.
                    The red and black ‘classical’ border was printed for George
                    Anstey, a leading London linen-draper, in 1804. The Chinese
                    vases come from two fabrics printed at Bannister Hall in
                    1805 and 1806. Family history undertaken by the donor
                    suggests that the quilt may have been made for an affluent
                    Lancashire family between 1811 and 1815.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second relevant coverlet in the collection dates from
                    around 1820, and shows a variety of printed cottons
                    appliquéd on a white linen ground (V&amp;A museum no:
                    T.399-1970). The appliquéd prints are mostly flowers, but
                    brightly coloured block printed birds have also been used on
                    the outer border. These fashionable coverlets display the
                    freedom to choose the textiles for the benefit of the
                    design, declaring the household’s access to luxury goods.
                    The Rajah Quilt similarly draws on the popularity of
                    Broderie Perse as a technique, and the desirability of
                    printed cotton chintzes.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn28" id="page-patchwork-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup></strong>
                    Carolyn Ferguson has undertaken detailed research on the
                    Rajah Quilt for the Quilter’s Guild of the British Isles,
                    and suggests that although it is extremely difficult to say
                    where the fabrics were acquired from, it is likely that the
                    ladies of the Convict Ship Committee would have sourced them
                    from the Manchester merchants operating from warehouses in
                    the Cheapside area of London.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn29" id="page-patchwork-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup></strong>
                    In particular, Ferguson suggests that the four birds shown
                    on the central panel connect to the printed cottons produced
                    in Manchester, such as those inspired by the prints of John
                    Potts.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn30" id="page-patchwork-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup></strong>
                    Such printed cottons would have provided a visual reference
                    to the world of trade and commerce, connecting these women
                    to a cross-section of contemporary textile technologies and
                    markets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also important to note that the Rajah Quilt was not a
                    singular example of patchwork created during transportation
                    although, as discussed, it is the only known example in a
                    public collection. As Ferguson notes, a convict on board the
                    ‘Brother’ (1823) sent Fry a calabash as a gift and recorded
                    that she used the patchwork quilt she had made on her bed,
                    while Surgeon Wilson on the Princess Royal reported that
                    many of the women made patchwork quilts and some of them
                    were left behind on the ship.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn31" id="page-patchwork-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup></strong>
                    Furthermore, in ‘The Fatal Shore’, Robert Hughes describes a
                    court scene enacted by convicts on deck for the purposes of
                    entertainment; ‘cathartic parodies in which the ‘judge’,
                    robed in a patchwork quilt with a swab combed over his head
                    for a wig, his face made up with red-lead, chalk and
                    stove-backing, would volley denunciations at the cowering
                    ‘prisoner’.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn32" id="page-patchwork-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup></strong>
                    Hughes also describes the appearance of the great hulls as
                    vast floating ‘street tenements’, with ‘lines of bedding
                    strung out to air between the stumps of the masts’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn33" id="page-patchwork-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup></strong>
                    These accounts suggest the presence of patchwork on the
                    visual landscape of the ship, integrated into performances
                    and part of the daily routine of the convict. Each surviving
                    quilt acts as a vessel for its respective narrative,
                    testifying to the convict’s endurance of their journey and
                    the handing down of individual accounts of life at
                    sea.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn34" id="page-patchwork-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup></strong>

                  <h2>The Fine Cell Work commission</h2>
                  <p>
                    The recent Fine Cell Work commission for the V&amp;A engages
                    with this complex history of patchwork produced during
                    confinement. Fine Cell Work is a Registered Charity that
                    teaches needlework to prison inmates. It is based on the
                    vision of Lady Anne Tree, a longstanding prison visitor,
                    entertainments officer at HMP Wandsworth and a prison
                    inspector who continues to support and guide the charity.
                    Fine Cell Work operates through a philanthropic model that
                    reflects Elizabeth Fry’s emphasis on community
                    consciousness. Volunteers work with small groups (of around
                    eleven or twelve) inmates, teaching various needlework
                    skills. Quilting and patchwork skills are taught to all-male
                    groups at HMP Wandsworth. Prisoners involved with the
                    charity carry out their needlework while confined to their
                    cells. Once trained, inmates can be responsible for
                    difficult commissions and support other inmates who are
                    still learning. As one of the inmates enrolled on the scheme
                    points out, one of the benefits of this structure is that it
                    ‘is more consistent and reliable than say education classes
                    because you can do it when you want and in your own time.
                    You can learn from other people.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn35" id="page-patchwork-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup></strong>
                    The act of stitching allows the maker to reclaim time as his
                    own. In an environment of finite choices and extensive
                    periods of isolation, this allows the maker to transform
                    hours of confinement into a period of productivity and
                    creativity. At the centre of the Fine Cell Works ethos sits
                    this notion of the individual inmate: the creator, producer
                    and stitcher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Integral to the success of the charity is the fostering of a
                    sub-culture within the prison that returns to the basic
                    principles of Elizabeth Fry’s reforms: the fruitful
                    relationship between creativity and industry. Prisoners are
                    paid for their work. This ‘generates skills and
                    independence, while also allowing them to save for their
                    release’, hence reducing the likelihood of a return to
                    crime.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn36" id="page-patchwork-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup></strong>
                    Prisoners often send the money that they earn from Fine Cell
                    Work to their children and families, or use it to pay debts
                    or for accommodation upon release.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn37" id="page-patchwork-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup></strong>
                    They also develop a skills base that may be useful to them
                    beyond the prison gates. This includes not only the
                    practical aspects of stitching, but also engagement with
                    design initiatives, working to project deadlines and
                    collaborative interaction with the volunteers who instruct
                    them.

                    The footprint of the V&amp;A commission is based on the
                    Panoptican design of Wandsworth Prison. The quilt will be
                    sewn and designed by inmates across the prison estate,
                    supported by V&amp;A Curator Sue Prichard. The project
                    appears in the wake of several collaborative initiatives
                    between museums and prison charities seeking to reduce the
                    number of inmates who re-offend. In 2006, the Museum of
                    London curated the ‘Mind’s Eye’, featuring twenty-five
                    paintings and fourteen pieces of creative writing by inmates
                    of HMP Wandsworth. Working in collaboration with
                    professional artists and writers, the inmates offered
                    remembrances of London following a series of workshops with
                    artists and writers.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn38" id="page-patchwork-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup></strong>
                    The exhibition was part of a three-year programme supported
                    by the Heritage Lottery Fund to engage people at risk of
                    social exclusion with their heritage.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn39" id="page-patchwork-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    Prior to this, the ‘Black Box’ project (2002–03) involved
                    museums and galleries in East and West Sussex working with
                    prisoners from Ford Prison in Arundel, ‘to create personal
                    museums of the imagination’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn40" id="page-patchwork-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup></strong>
                    Participants were invited to take part in a series of
                    workshops led by poets and supported by museum staff and
                    artists. Inspired by artefacts brought in from museum
                    collections, they worked ‘only with images and
                    words’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn41" id="page-patchwork-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup></strong>
                    Participants were encouraged to organise and interpret an
                    imaginary space, dividing it into separate ‘rooms’ to house
                    ‘significant, precious and hated things’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn42" id="page-patchwork-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup></strong>
                    The project was funded by the MLA South East (Museums,
                    Libraries and Archives), with the aim of engaging ‘hard to
                    reach’ audiences with local collections. The MLA also funded
                    and supported ‘Project Hero’ during the same period,
                    described as ‘creative reader and writer development courses
                    around graphic novels and artefacts for young offenders who
                    were disaffected with education’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn43" id="page-patchwork-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup></strong>
                    The Museum of Reading and Reading’s Prison Library worked
                    with young men in the Separated Prisoners Unit at HM Young
                    Offenders Institute, Reading. External evaluation suggests
                    that the pilot project ‘raised the young men’s self esteem
                    and enhanced their key skills in literacy, creativity,
                    communication and social interaction’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn44" id="page-patchwork-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup></strong>
                    Since 2003, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has been
                    working with a number of prisons throughout England on the
                    ‘Virtual Egypt’ project.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn45" id="page-patchwork-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup></strong>
                    Sally-Ann Ashton, a specialist in Egyptology, has been
                    collaborating with prisoners and prison education
                    departments to develop educational resources (in particular,
                    a virtual walk through of the recently refurbished Egyptian
                    galleries). The resulting material will be used for project
                    work in prisons, and also as a public resource. The project
                    combines ‘specialist knowledge with specific cultural
                    experiences to provide learning opportunities and
                    methodologies adapted to those unable to visit museums but
                    of value for much wider application’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn46" id="page-patchwork-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup></strong>

                    Furthering the potential of projects that bring together
                    design-led and social rehabilitation initiatives, a recent
                    exhibition entitled ‘The Creative Prison’ explored the ways
                    in which contemporary architecture could offer solutions to
                    current prison conditions.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn47" id="page-patchwork-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup></strong>
                    The project was developed by architect Will Alsop, artists
                    Shona Illingworth and Jon Ford, and led by the arts
                    organisation Rideout (Creative Arts for Rehabilitation).
                    Collaborating with the staff and inmates of HMP Gartree,
                    Leicestershire, ‘The Creative Prison’ examined how the
                    design of prisons ‘informs their effectiveness and
                    challenges attitudes to current prisoner
                    rehabilitation’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn48" id="page-patchwork-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup></strong>
                    The resulting development of an imaginary prison suggested
                    the ways in which architecture could improve safety,
                    interaction and educational activity. It also encouraged
                    prisoners to think proactively about the theme of
                    rehabilitation through film and sculpture.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn49" id="page-patchwork-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all instances, the emphasis has been on engaging the
                    prisoners with their personal and collective memories,
                    particularly in relation to museum collections, while also
                    increasing their skills base and encouraging a proactive
                    approach to reintegration into the community. The V&amp;A
                    and Fine Cell Work collaboration continues in this vein. The
                    emphasis of the project is on creative expression, personal
                    reflection and community, centred on the act of bringing the
                    participants together to quilt and share their experiences.
                    Recent feedback from stitchers suggests that the resulting
                    acts of communal discourse reinvigorate the prison
                    environment as a site of creative energy. One participant
                    commented on his enjoyment of quilting ‘with so many
                    different people’, recognising that ‘each has their own
                    perspective’.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn50" id="page-patchwork-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup></strong>
                    For this individual, the act of quilting represents the
                    opportunity to forge links with fellow prisoners:

                      ‘It gives you a purpose to relate to other people. It’s
                      difficult talking to strangers but if you can do it with a
                      reason it helps. You get more sociable because you’re
                      chasing people for materials! … You can learn from other
                      people and teach them something as well. You feel you’ve
                      advanced your knowledge and experience.’<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn51" id="page-patchwork-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup></strong>

                    Large periods of confinement restrict each prisoner’s
                    opportunity to share and attain knowledge and skills, but
                    the co-operative act of creating the quilt engenders a
                    dialogue focused on acts of progression and knowledge.

                    Each prisoner involved with the commission has the
                    opportunity to design and stitch their own hexagon, which
                    will then be pieced into the larger template of the quilt.
                    Hexagons already completed by prisoners demonstrate a clear
                    conversation with both the history of the British prison
                    system and contemporary discourses on trade and authority.
                    Moving away from the submissive tone and general acceptance
                    present in the inscription of the Rajah Quilt, the HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt offers a critical engagement with the
                    system in which the prisoner is encased. The following
                    design displays the longstanding association between labour
                    and prison life.

                    The overbearing hand of authority (Figure 1) dominates the
                    physical landscape, overtly referencing the hard and
                    monotonous prison tasks of marching and rock-breaking
                    promoted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
                    as punishing/suitableforms of employment for prisoners.

                  <p>
                    In placing the hand in plain view, the stitcher also
                    encourages a contemplation of the absolute importance of the
                    hand in the life of the prisoner (both metaphorically in the
                    hand of authority, and literally as the tool of salvation
                    for the stitcher). Many of the hexagons return us to the
                    image of the hand or the physical impression left by it.

                    Here (fig. 2), a fingerprint is surrounded by borders of
                    DNA, references the heightened interest in the scientific
                    identification of the criminal (through fingerprinting and
                    recent developments in forensics). It also suggests wider
                    discourses on personal freedom, and government initiatives
                    to introduce tighter forms of identification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other hexagons (fig. 3) engage directly with the action of
                    the probation board, and return us to the process of
                    stitching by bringing the needle and thread to the
                    foreground to present the tools of the maker.

                  <p>
                    The diversity of these designs demonstrates the continuing
                    appeal of the needle as a tool of both subversion and
                    salvation, and the critical dialogue initiated by the
                    prisoners challenges current attitudes to prison life.

                    Many reflect on the ongoing presence of punitive measures in
                    the face of growing external and internal pressures on the
                    prison system, including steadily increasing numbers of
                    inmates (and serious overcrowding) and constraints in public
                    expenditure.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn52" id="page-patchwork-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup></strong>

                    Within this environment, the enduring appeal of the needle

                      I’m a life-serving prisoner and for years I have been
                      trying to escape. I have tried numerous cell hobbies which
                      promptly ended up discarded in the corner of the cell as
                      so much rubbish. Due to depression, most of the time I’ve
                      been unwashed, unshaven, teeth not cleaned, hair not
                      combed, as often as not my cell has been dirty and
                      stinking. I’ve had no possessions, nobody to love me, just
                      hanging onto a futile, empty and miserable existence.

                      was in this world, I am good for nothing, no money, no
                      family and with no-one I could go to for help. I just
                      couldn’t understand why I should go on living. Then
                      something happened to me.

                      I was lying in my cell one evening when a bloke came in
                      and asked if I can help him. I didn’t know the fella, but
                      he had helped me with cigarette papers and teabags. He
                      explained how he’d broken his glasses and needed to finish
                      a pattern he was sewing for the in-cell charity course.
                      Although I class myself as being very butch and sewing so
                      very feminine, I figured I owed him, so I agreed to help
                      him finish his work. He showed me what it was I had to do,
                      I made him promise not to tell anybody and I hid it in a
                      cupboard in my cell. About nine o’clock I got it out and
                      started sewing. Before I knew where I was they started
                      unlocking us for breakfast, a whole night had come and
                      gone with no thoughts of suicide, and no tears of

                    For this individual who perceives himself emotionally and
                    physically trapped, the needle offers focus and purpose, and
                    the possibility of mental ‘escape’ from the monotony of
                    prison life. Initially ashamed of engaging in what he
                    perceives as gendered work, the prisoner develops a strong
                    sense of fulfilment and achievement based on the act of
                    stitching.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the Fine Cell Work stitchers acknowledge not only
                    the reassuring rhythmic repetition of the act of sewing, but
                    also the cultural meaning attached to the objects that they
                    produce. There is often a great poignancy for participants
                    in offering up their own time and designs for public
                    consumption, and the realisation that something important to
                    them is appreciated by the rest of society. A prisoner’s
                    comment that ‘we’re like a forgotten community’ acknowledges
                    the shared experiences of those within the prison walls, but
                    also the strong sense of alienation that comes into being
                    when entering or leaving the prison gates.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-patchwork-fn54" id="page-patchwork-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup></strong>
                    For this reason, the Fine Cell Work participants sew in the
                    knowledge that the HMP Wandsworth Quilt will be on view in a
                    public exhibition in 2010, striking a connection between the
                    exhibition audience and the prisoners who helped to create
                    it. As part of the permanent collections at the V&amp;A, it
                    will also form a lasting legacy for these men, tying
                    together personal memories to form a collective document of
                    prison life as it stands in 2010.

                    In dialogue with the Rajah Quilt, it is hoped that the HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt will encourage an understanding of quilts
                    as part of a hybrid history of creative practice. The HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt both resonates with the complexity of this
                    history, remembering the skills and experiences of past
                    prisoners, and explores the continuing relevance of the
                    prison as a site of creativity.

                          India suggests that in Poona ‘the industries are
                          varied. Men were weaving a fine rug, the director
                          chanting the indications of the pattern from a
                          manuscript, while the weavers responded antiphonally
                          and placed the threads, and so the figures grew to the
                          rhythm of music’. See&nbsp; Henderson, Charles Richmond.

                          Between 1718 and 1775 around 30,000 convicts were
                          transported to the West Indies and North America for
                          periods of between seven and fourteen years. From
                          1787, around 160,000 convicts were transported to
                          Australia over a period of 80 years. See Nick Flynn

                          When transportation to the American colonies was
                          interrupted in 1776 by the American War of
                          Independence, old sailing ships known as ‘hulks’ had
                          to be brought into use on the Thames. In 1779 an Act
                          introduced a new concept of hard labour for prisoners
                          in the hulks, commencing with dredging the river
                          Thames, and made provision for the building of two
                          penitentiaries. There was considerable delay in
                          building these institutions. Transportation to
                          Australia became possible in 1787, thus relieving the
                          pressure on the hulks, so it was not until 1816 that
                          construction of convict prisons commenced. Hulks
                          continued to be used until 1859 and at one time
                          contained 70,000 prisoners, many being French
                          prisoners of war captured after the defeat of
                          Napoleon. See Amy Edwards, ‘Home Office: 1782–1982’

                          The reformatory view of prisons between 1815 and 1835
                          was in the large part characterised by the zeal of
                          religious societies. For example, the Society for the
                          Improvement of Prison Discipline and the Reformation
                          of Juvenile Offenders was active during this time, and

                          of the Church of England such as Joseph Fry, William

                          For example, the V&amp;A holds a sampler stitched by
                          Elizabeth Parker. The sampler tells the story of its
                          maker in red stitches on a neutral ground. She
                          describes her family, the violence and ‘cruelty’ that
                          she encounters when she enters into service at the age
                          of thirteen, and her thoughts on taking her own life.
                          The narrative ends ambiguously, with Elizabeth
                          contemplating ‘what will become of my soul’. For

                          The later examples of the Changi quilts, created by
                          women in the internment camps after the surrender of
                          Singapore to Japanese troops in 1942, affirm the close
                          affiliation between quilting and systems of
                          communication. Although these women were prisoners of
                          war rather than convicts, each patch communicates the
                          survival of a woman, her endurance, her time passed,
                          and her refusal to disappear from the visual
                          landscape. One of these quilts is now held by the
                          British Red Cross Museum in London. See

                          Ibid. Government statistics suggest that six out of
                          ten prisoners reoffend with two years of their
                          release, and economic pressures are often cited as one
                          of the main reasons. Recent policy documents such as
                          ‘Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment’
                          (2005) and ‘Reducing Re-Offending Through Skills and
                          Employment: Next Steps’ (2006) set out how education
                          and learning can contribute to this goal. These
                          documents are accessible via the

                          (cited 2008). Liza Ramrayka offers an analysis of the
                          exhibition and its relation to reform initiatives, and
                          suggests its high success rate. Of the 15 inmates who
                          started the project, 11 completed the course. The
                          weekly attendance rate was 86%, and 50% of those who
                          completed an evaluation for the Museum of London said
                          that they had acquired useful knowledge or skills ‘to
                          a high extent’, while the same proportion said they
                          had done so ‘to a good extent’. See Liza Ramrayka,

                    I peer through the doors of the sparkling new residency
                    studio in the V&amp;A’s Sackler Centre for arts education,
                    where artist Dorothy Hogg is working. Dorothy, a jeweller
                    and metalworker, was awarded a six-month residency here, and
                    has made it her mission to create an inviting workspace.
                    Images of her jewellery line the walls and real examples
                    stand out in cases and on boards, revealing her processes
                    and current work. Examples of workshop booty are pinned up
                    on the wall, alongside explanations of past and future
                    projects linked to Dorothy’s residency at the Museum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘This came at a good time for me’ Dorothy says. She recently
                    retired from her post as head of the Silversmithing and
                    Jewellery Department at Edinburgh College of Art, where she
                    had been since 1985. Official retirement has enabled her to
                    take up opportunities such as this residency, utterly
                    breaking away from her normal routines, environment and ways
                    of working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dorothy is internationally recognised as a teacher and as an
                    artist. ‘I’m a teacher. That’s what I do,’ she explains. I
                    don’t have to ask much as Dorothy talks me through her work,
                    anticipating my questions, revealing her thoughts and
                    directions, and asking for my opinions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dorothy’s CV reveals a lifetime of success as a
                    world-renowned maker. In 2001 Dorothy was awarded an MBE for
                    services to Jewellery and Silversmithing. Throughout her
                    life, Dorothy has juggled home, teaching and her own
                    creative practice, also finding time to curate exhibitions,
                    sit on educational and craft boards, and promote Scottish
                    Jewellery across the world, by curating exhibitions, for
                    example the two incarnations of the internationally touring
                    exhibition of Scottish jewellery and silversmithing
                    <em>100% Proof</em> in 2001 and 2006; and by her support of
                    exhibitions such as Silver of the Stars. This was an
                    internationally touring exhibition of work made in Scotland
                    in collaboration with Scottish celebrities. It came to the
                    V&amp;A in 2007.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dorothy leads me through a brief history of her jewellery
                    and working processes. She shows me a case she calls her
                    ‘Jewellery Sketchbook’: a beautiful display of
                    three-dimensional ideas; trial runs of techniques and
                    designs. ‘Artists have sketchbooks,’ she remarks, ‘but I
                    wanted to show visitors how metalworkers work’. Dorothy
                    makes sketches in a book, and then, before creating a piece
                    of work, will often trial pieces of her design by making a
                    model or three-dimensional ‘sketch’. This case reveals
                    Dorothy’s interest in the minute details of each object as
                    well as highlighting her technical abilities. She likes to
                    try making parts of an object to see how they work. She is
                    fascinated by craft processes.

                        Artist jeweller Dorothy Hogg is the V&amp;A’s first
                        artist in residence in partnership with the Craft’s
                        Council. Dorothy is a well-known jewellery artist
                        working primarily with precious metals.</span>

                  <p>
                    The direction Dorothy’s work takes expresses ideas which
                    relate form to the human body. The sources for these formal
                    interactions spring from a fusion of the subconscious with
                    her visual experience. She explains that while she is at the
                    V&amp;A, she is not looking for inspiration but for a
                    resonance with objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Dorothy, design is a process of combining her ideas,
                    influences and interests with what is happening internally.
                    She points out examples of her early work of the 1960s and
                    1970s which are very angular. ‘I think this style shows that
                    I was quite stressed then,’ she considers. Dorothy is
                    clearly aligned to the world of contemporary jewellery in
                    which objects express an artist’s response to the world.
                    This is in contrast to more traditional or commercial
                    jewellery-making, where the maker’s personality is hidden
                    beneath conventional designs which often function to
                    highlight the wealth and status of the owner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the 1960s Dorothy used enamel frequently, often the
                    translucent plique-à-jour enamel. She liked the way that
                    when a particular plique-à-jour enamelled ring was worn,
                    light cast coloured shadows onto the skin. In the 1970s
                    though, to use a Scottish term, she ‘scunnered herself
                    [became tired] of enamelling’. The process of grinding paste
                    and producing enamelled angular shapes became too
                    burdensome, Dorothy explains.‘But who knows, I may go back
                    to it’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A later series of work shows Dorothy’s strong interest in
                    the inherent versatility of a piece of jewellery. ‘Spirit
                    Level’ is a series of jewellery that incorporates delicate
                    metal loops that slide along silver bars. Dorothy likes the
                    way that the jewellery changes depending on who wears it and
                    how it is worn. A lot depends on the wearer, but of course
                    Dorothy can’t predict who will wear each piece. ‘You can
                    only make them for you and see what happens’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘I’m pretty obsessed with hollow forms’ Dorothy confesses,
                    talking of her more recent work in particular. She makes
                    thin oval tubes of silver, shaping them to her designs. They
                    are organic, flowing forms. ‘I’ve noticed there is often a
                    tension between lines or forms moving in opposite directions
                    in my work’. Proportion is very important. Aiming at
                    something beyond the aesthetic, Dorothy is not only creating
                    ‘something that looks nice – there’s a kind of private
                    language going on’.

                    Dorothy uses colour too. In this recent tubular collection,
                    entitled the ‘Artery Series’ and incorporating pieces such
                    as ‘Memento Mori’, she uses red felt. ‘Not because I like
                    the colour red, but because it is important to use red for
                    its symbolic value’. She used red beads for the neckpiece in
                    the Artery series commissioned for Birmingham Museum and Art
                    Gallery’s collection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this piece it looks as though the beads are simply and
                    deftly embedded in the silver cone-shaped openings of the
                    neckpiece. In fact the technical detail involved in
                    internally fixing the beads in place by means of a basket
                    structure attached to a handmade spring is incredible.
                    Dorothy is a meticulous metalworker, and her patience and
                    skill are manifest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The residency at the V&amp;A has given Dorothy extensive
                    access to the Museum’s collections. She explains that she is
                    not always interested in the historical dates and details of
                    pieces of the jewellery collection, as much as their
                    aesthetic and technical qualities. She is visually moved.&nbsp;
                    When ‘devouring the collection’, as she puts it, she was
                    drawn to objects such as a plain ring. ‘It was a very simple
                    ring of lovely proportion but it had changed dimension by
                    being worn. You could see it had a history’. Dorothy is
                    interested in the stories that objects can tell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dorothy looks at objects through maker’s eyes. Another piece
                    that caught her eye was a seed pearl necklace (right) strung
                    together with horsehair. In this case she was intrigued by
                    the messy patterns that the knots created at the back of the
                    necklace.

                    Dorothy is not intending to emulate these pieces but is
                    fascinated by their design and how they were made. She finds
                    enormous pleasure in looking closely at objects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since being at the V&amp;A Dorothy has left behind her
                    Edinburgh studio equipped with everything she needs as a
                    silversmith. In the Museum flames are restricted, making
                    annealing and soldering metal impossible, and so Dorothy has
                    been in her words ‘liberated’ during this period to make
                    work using materials other than metal. As metalworking is
                    such a measured process, this break has given Dorothy an
                    opportunity to experiment and ‘loosen up, be a bit random’,
                    even if only temporarily. At the moment she is busy creating
                    ‘Sackler jewels’ as she calls them, delicately sewn out of
                    discarded plastic packing materials. She found plastic
                    tubing from the new Sackler Centre chairs discarded in a
                    skip outside the Museum, and carried them up to her workshop
                    to experiment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using recycled materials works well within the framework of
                    the residency and the outreach work she does. They are
                    easily accessible and don’t necessarily require any special
                    skills to transform them. Dorothy wants to increase access
                    to the processes and techniques of jewellery making. She
                    wants to encourage people to recognise the potential of
                    materials they find. ‘Things can look amazing without doing
                    much to them’, Dorothy comments as she drapes a fragile
                    piece of netting around her neck, suddenly transforming it
                    into an elegant choker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dorothy has a blog on the V&amp;A website that she calls
                    <strong>Jewellery Resonances</strong>. It contains a wealth
                    of information about her and the residency. Dorothy aims to
                    use it to encourage people both to use recycled materials
                    and to transform unlikely materials for Jewellery making.
                    She would like website visitors to ‘find, make and wear’ and
                    send in a photograph.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the fact that Dorothy can’t use a large flame, she
                    is still using metal in the workshop. She has to employ
                    simpler techniques, which in any case are easier for the
                    public to work with. In a recent three-day workshop with
                    wire, Dorothy encouraged her students to experiment,
                    investigating linking and chain techniques to create
                    decorative structures, chain mail, and knitted structures in
                    wire, trapping and attaching objects to create their own
                    pieces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Workshops play a large part in the residency. For the
                    official opening of the Sackler centre on the weekend of
                    26–9 October 2008, Dorothy is going to run an activity for
                    4,000 visitors called the ‘Chain of Talent’ project. An
                    oversize chain will be suspended through part of the Museum
                    and visitors will be invited to make a charm to add to this
                    ‘charm bracelet chain of talent’.

                    For another workshop, Dorothy was inspired by Lady Cory’s
                    corsage ornament (right), a star piece in the V&amp;A’s
                    William and Judith Bollinger Jewellery Gallery. It is an
                    enormous nineteenth-century bodice ornament in the form of a
                    bouquet, encrusted with diamonds on springs that tremble
                    elegantly with the movement of the wearer. I can see that
                    Dorothy is interested in how this piece of jewellery changes
                    in sync with the wearer’s movements. Dorothy recognises the
                    potential of this quivering jewellery and how it could be
                    applied to a project for school children. They will develop
                    designs for brooches and door plaques, and the separate
                    elements of the designs will tremble on small springs. Some
                    examples are pinned to her wall, demonstrating the
                    impressive effects achieved with basic materials. It must be
                    great fun too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the residency is supported by the Crafts Council, as
                    well as running workshops and making her own work, Dorothy
                    is involved with various creative mentoring schemes for
                    emerging crafts people, run by the Crafts Council and
                    Cockpit Arts. She is also involved with the organisation
                    <a href="#page-http-www-innovativecraft-co-uk" target="_blank">Innovative Craft</a>, an initiative led by Amanda Game to develop events and
                    exhibitions that will highlight excellence, achievement and
                    innovation in craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The residency at the V&amp;A is certainly wide ranging, and
                    has exploited Dorothy’s skills as both an artist and
                    teacher. She has proven her versatility and creativity in
                    adapting to new materials and techniques, and what is
                    conveyed in our brief meeting is how well Dorothy can gauge
                    people’s interests and enthuse them about jewellery. In just
                    an hour she has opened my mind – and I want to learn more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Where will the residency lead Dorothy? She has immediate
                    plans. She will be showing her work at Goldsmiths’ Hall,
                    London, in May 2009 and is currently curating an exhibition
                    at Contemporary Applied Arts (CAA Gallery, London) to open
                    in June 2009. Dorothy has enjoyed her time at the V&amp;A
                    and feels that for her, ‘a door has been opened to a new set
                    of visual experiences and opportunities’. I am looking
                    forward to seeing what comes next.
