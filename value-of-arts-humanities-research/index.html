                  <p>
                    Arts and Humanities research directly informs the key
                    activities of a national museum like the Victoria and Albert
                    Museum (V&amp;A). The Museum serves as an international
                    centre of excellence in the fields of the history of art and
                    design, conservation, learning and interpretation and
                    contemporary creative practice, and its programmes benefit
                    from research that is designed to contribute both to the
                    public understanding and experience of its collections, and
                    to the methodological and theoretical advancement of
                    relevant arts and humanities disciplines. The V&amp;A
                    therefore fosters a proactive research culture, both in
                    developing public outcomes that are underpinned by current
                    scholarship (its galleries, high-profile exhibitions,
                    publications, conferences and website) and in fostering
                    collaborations with academic partners.

                  <p>
                    As a frequent recipient of Arts and Humanities Research
                    Council and other research grants the V&amp;A is well
                    practiced in recognising and capitalising on opportunities
                    to enhance the value of its activities and outputs through
                    ambitious, authoritative and accessible research programmes.
                    This essay will discuss recent examples of externally-funded
                    projects at the V&amp;A where innovative object,
                    collections, exhibitions and archive-based research has made
                    a demonstrable and positive impact on both specialist
                    knowledge and the quality of the visitor experience,
                    stimulating debate on past and present cultures, and
                    encouraging new approaches to scholarship and the
                    dissemination of expertise in the UK and beyond.

                  <p>
                    Much recent debate on the value of the public arts sector
                    (including museums and galleries) has focused on its
                    measurable contribution to the national economy via the
                    creative industries, tourism and a vibrant art market, and
                    to the quality of life of individuals and communities. It is
                    certainly the case that the UKâs museums play an important
                    role in raising social capital, encouraging inclusion and
                    kick-starting urban regeneration. Less has been said
                    however, on the ways in which the practice of Arts and
                    Humanities research underpins these initiatives,
                    particularly in the context of the museum exhibition and
                    display. The following case-studies demonstrate the
                    significant impact that such research activities can make
                    via the public presentation of the nationâs material and
                    cultural assets.
                  </p>
                  <h3>i. Object-led research</h3>
                  <p>
                    The most distinctive feature of museum-based research is
                    that it is based on objects. Prompted by artefacts from the
                    past, museums have traditionally tended to ask very focused
                    questions about dating, authorship, manufacture, and usage.
                    While this approach was once seen as conservative by
                    academics, in recent years the idea that objects should be
                    given priority â that they should determine the course of
                    research, rather than serving as data â has become more and
                    more accepted. Indeed, many observers agree that there has
                    been a âmaterial turnâ in fields such as anthropology,
                    social history, and even literary studies, comparable to the
                    much-discussed âlinguistic turnâ that occurred in the
                    humanities some thirty years ago. The shift towards
                    materiality has encouraged museum professionals and academic
                    researchers to work together more closely than ever before,
                    particularly in the UK. This has been beneficial to all
                    concerned. UK-based museum curators have broadened the range
                    of questions that they ask of their collections, and the
                    focus on objects has similarly transformed the methods and
                    goals of scholarly research and learning in the British
                    higher education sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are multiple advantages to be gained by placing
                    objects at the centre of a collaborative research project,
                    rather than in the margins. First and foremost, artefacts
                    exert friction on the researcher. General theories are
                    invariably tested by the specificity and concreteness of
                    objects, which rarely conform to expectation. Partly for
                    this reason, object-led research is fundamentally
                    interdisciplinary. Fully accounting for the research
                    potential of even a single object might require
                    contributions by historians of art, culture, science, and
                    economics as well as specialists in conservation and other
                    scientific disciplines.

                  <p>
                    Take, for example, the decorated beer mug inscribed â1701â.
                    Such an object can be studied, first of all, on the basis of
                    its appearance. Its somewhat old-fashioned decoration in
                    slip (liquid clay) attests to stylistic conservatism in
                    Staffordshire, the place of its manufacture. Yet if we
                    inquire further, we might find that the mug was implicated
                    in new networks of distribution. The materials used to make
                    it may have been sourced from far away, and the finished
                    object sold in a distant city, or even abroad in America and
                    Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We might ask where and how the mug was used. Through the
                    comparative study of objects like this one we can learn
                    about communal drinking habits, the emergence of new venues
                    for socialization, and attitudes towards intoxication. Or we
                    might wonder about the significance of its date inscription,
                    which would lead to questions about attitudes to marriage,
                    childbirth, or political commemoration. The mug would
                    probably have been used across a broad spectrum of society,
                    from the âplainer sortsâ to the upwardly mobile mercantile
                    class. This is a further advantage of object-led research:
                    it often yields evidence of a wider demographic range than
                    textual sources do. In periods where many people were
                    illiterate or semi-literate, or where documents are scarce,
                    objects can often be the only means of accessing the
                    experience of the majority of people â people whose
                    descendants now form a core audience for museum displays and
                    popular histories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite all these benefits, object-based research also poses
                    its own challenges. First and foremost, though museum
                    collections are often defined by the goal of preservation,
                    researchers are forced to think about the objects they hold
                    as dynamic. Unlike most textual forms of historic evidence,
                    material things are subject to constant change through
                    modification, wear and repair. Though authenticity and
                    originality are prized, the fact is that when it comes to
                    objects from the past, alteration is the norm, not the
                    exception.

                    Museum-based conservation offers a disciplinary basis for
                    research into such issues. The techniques of the scientist
                    and the conservator can be used to gain access not only to
                    the moment of an objectâs creation, but also its entire
                    lifespan: a principle that lies at the heart of the
                    V&amp;Aâs recent research project focusing on the Mazarin
                    Chest (funded by the Getty Foundation and the Toshiba
                    International Foundation, supported by the Japan Foundation
                    and the Tobunken, and carried out at the V&amp;A, Imperial
                    College, Loughborough University, Dresden Academy of Fine
                    Arts and the Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry,
                    Polish Academy of Sciences). The chest is a most unusual
                    example of seventeenth-century Japanese lacquerwork, of a
                    very high quality that would normally not have been exported
                    to Europe. Its history of ownership permits us to see it in
                    relation to a long series of people and places â from its
                    Japanese makers to its initial owners, the Mazarin family of
                    France, from the Romantic-era collector William Beckford, to
                    the V&amp;A itself (the museum acquired the object in 1882).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Mazarin Chest project also shed light on differing
                    cultural attitudes to historic objects in the present day.
                    The goal was to develop an integrated approach to the
                    conservation of lacquer objects that respects both western
                    conservation ethics, in which concern with the
                    re-treatability of objects is paramount, and Japanese
                    conservation values, which seek to preserve the cultural
                    continuity of objects by employing, as far as possible,
                    materials and techniques similar to those used at the time
                    of manufacture. The chest has thus been a basis not only for
                    nuanced historic research but also new international
                    exchanges of knowledge and understanding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final advantage of object-led research is its direct
                    connection to physical experience. Every researcher who has
                    worked in a museum knows that handling unfamiliar objects
                    for the first time is among the most thrilling aspects of
                    their work. This excitement is telling us something: through
                    touch, we can begin to ask new questions about those
                    different from ourselves. For those interested in issues
                    such as comportment, the senses, and sexual and ethnic
                    identity, materiality can provide routes into unspoken (and
                    perhaps even unconscious) cultural values. Fashion â a
                    subject to which we will return â is a particularly obvious
                    example. Thinking about the self-regulating function of
                    garments, from the kimono to the corset, is an instance in
                    which research can make the lived experience of cultural
                    difference immediately palpable to all.

                  <h3>ii. Collections-based research</h3>
                  <p>
                    Like the objects which form their content, permanent
                    collections such as those housed at the V&amp;A are not
                    inert. They are a live inheritance that requires constant
                    re-interpretation and new models of communication if they
                    are to speak effectively to contemporary audiences and
                    enhance our sense of the complex, globalised
                    twenty-first-century world as an entity with historical
                    roots and challenging futures. Research is one of the
                    methods by which we realise the social and cultural value of
                    the assets that museums hold on behalf of the public, an
                    obvious point but one that is too rarely made in press
                    coverage and reviews of headline exhibitions and gallery
                    developments. Two current research projects help to
                    elucidate the relevance of our material heritage as
                    represented in the Museumâs collections to the diverse
                    communities of the UK.

                    âFashioning Diaspora Spaceâ is a three-year collaboration
                    between the V&amp;A and Royal Holloway University of London.
                    It is funded by the AHRC as part of the âDiasporas,
                    Identities and Migrationâ Programme and examines the
                    presence in the UK of South Asian (Indian and Pakistani)
                    textiles intended for use in clothing. In the context of the
                    Museum, the project is expanding knowledge about the
                    V&amp;Aâs collections of nineteenth-century Indian textiles,
                    not only in terms of identifying the objects, but also
                    through asking how and why these collections were formed,
                    how they have been used in the past and what they might mean
                    to current and future generations of curators, visitors,
                    designers and consumers. This research is also relevant to
                    the holdings of other museum collections from the City Art
                    Galleries and Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester, Paisley
                    Museum and Bath Fashion Museum, to the archives of past and
                    present textile manufacturers at Macclesfield Silk Archives,
                    Warners and J&amp;P Baker, as well as to the work of

                    implications for our understanding of wider British material

                    One of the earliest groups within the Indian textile
                    collections at the V&amp;A consists of examples acquired at
                    the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was the first time that
                    large numbers of the British public had seen what Indian
                    textile producers were capable of. The quality of Indian
                    hand woven silk, embroideries and muslins was unmatched by
                    industrial British textile manufacturers. In the 1860s and
                    70s many of the South Asian textiles in the collection were
                    cut up and put into two multi-volume sets of textile sample
                    books. These were sent around the country to both inspire
                    designers and manufacturers, and with a view to building up
                    the sales of British textiles to the Indian
                    subcontinent.Forthcoming entries on the V&amp;A website (the
                    non-destructive equivalent of these nineteenth-century
                    albums)about South Asian textiles in the Museum will make
                    relevant images and information on their history, context
                    and use universally available to a UK (and international)
                    audience for the first time since the middle of the
                    nineteenth century.

                  <p>
                    The story of the V&amp;Aâs South Asian textile collection is
                    typical of diaspora narratives, in its mixture of emulation,
                    destruction, and learning. These processes â both positive
                    and negative â are to be found in many other instances of
                    cultural exchange, international trade and migration. Indian
                    textiles, too, include vivid examples of objects whose very
                    surfaces play out the action of far-flung networks in their
                    materials and decoration. The investigation of a distinctive
                    Parsi Chinese embroidery consisting of a coloured embroidery
                    on white silk depicting birds among foliage shaped for a
                    jubla or girlâs shirt reveals longer histories and
                    connections. The Parsis of Bombay (Mumbai) were descendants
                    of the Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent
                    from Iran in the eighth century. Parsi-owned shipping
                    companies traded with China, returning with highly prized
                    Chinese goods including embroidered textiles. Some Chinese
                    embroiderers also settled in Surat, a port city in
                    Gujarat.This single jubla is thus the complex result of the
                    interwoven histories of four nations in two continents
                    spanning twelve centuries. New interpretations fostered
                    through the focused research of such an object (amongst many
                    others) indicate that it is time to move beyond postcolonial
                    hand wringing and progress in our understanding of a shared
                    human past.

                    A second example focuses on an aspect of the Museumâs
                    practices where research has revealed a previously
                    overlooked area of the V&amp;Aâs collecting history. The
                    thirty-month-long project, conducted as part of a Cultural
                    Ownership and Capacity Building Project and supported by the
                    Heritage Lottery Fund focuses on identifying and
                    interpreting Africa-related materials within the
                    collections. The undertaking builds on several years of
                    engagement with Black British communities, seeking to build
                    Black and Minority Ethnic audiences for the V&amp;A and to
                    develop collaborations and skill-sharing within the Black
                    heritage/culturalsector.

                  <p>
                    The V&amp;A has always collected the art and design of
                    Africa. Initially, its collecting focused on the northern
                    part of the continent. Thirteen Tunisian textiles were part
                    of the 1851 Great Exhibition purchases which formed the core
                    of the collection. Ancient Egyptian textiles and glassware
                    and Moroccan and Algerian ceramics and jewellery formed
                    other collecting strands through the second half of the
                    nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. This
                    same period witnessed a number of key imperial acquisitions
                    from sub-Saharan Africa including religious, ceremonial and
                    decorative items associated with Ethiopiaâs ruling family
                    acquired through the Abyssinian Expedition of 1868, and
                    thirteen pieces of largely gold regalia, probably associated
                    with the court of the Asante leader, acquired through the
                    British invasion of Kumasi, state capital of Asante, Ghana,
                    in 1874.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently, these African acquisitions have been
                    supplemented with objects that reflect the changing
                    political, social and cultural contexts of âpostcolonialâ
                    Africa. The Word and Image Department has been particularly
                    active, acquiring prints by African artists including Ben
                    Enwonwu, Tunde Odunlade, Paul Sibisi and David Koloane. The
                    cultural influence of the African diaspora is also
                    represented in acquisitions of work by Caribbean artists
                    such as Winston Branch and Aubrey Williams and Black British
                    artists such as Maud Sulter, Lubaina Himid, Chris Ofili and
                    Faisal AbduâAllah. It is hoped that this fresh,
                    research-informed awareness may fuel revisions to the
                    Museumâs collecting policy and encourage a more proactive,
                    creative approach to its Africa collections and their future
                    development.

                  <h3>iii. Exhibitions</h3>
                  <p>
                    Placed at the crossroads between scholarly enquiry and
                    communication with a wider audience, exhibitions are ideally
                    located to disseminatethe broad cultural, social and
                    economic benefits associated with the arts and humanities
                    field, positively engaging visitors in a much more direct
                    and immersive manner than other forms of media. Unlike other
                    academic outputs, exhibitions must confront the demands of
                    appealing to very large non-specialist audiences while
                    making specialist knowledge widely accessible. This unique
                    set of circumstances makes exhibitions a particularly
                    challenging and stimulating arena within which to explore
                    the value and impact of research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, exhibition-based research within the UK has
                    changed dramatically in character and scope. Museums have
                    been at the heart of a momentous cultural shift which has
                    transformed them from perceived passive recipients of
                    research-led initiatives to frontrunners. Fostered by an
                    increasing number of national and international research
                    funding schemes and policies designed to generate active
                    collaborations between museums, universities and colleges,
                    this radical transformation raises important questions about
                    the new character and purpose of exhibition-based research.
                    This is the framework within which the groundbreaking
                    exhibition âAt Home in Renaissance Italyâ (V&amp;A, October
                    2006 â January 2007) â the result of a four-year research
                    project funded by the Getty Foundation and the AHRC
                    -&nbsp;operated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research leading to an exhibition differs substantially
                    from conventional academic research. Centred on âthingsâ,
                    the research process must acknowledge that objects are
                    carriers of complex visual, material, cultural and social
                    meanings and that as such they should generate multiple
                    narratives and interpretations. This recognition often
                    demands breaking out of traditional disciplinary boundaries
                    and embracing an interdisciplinary outlook. The research for
                    âAt Home in Renaissance Italyâ was carried out by a
                    multi-disciplinary team including scholars working within
                    art, decorative arts and architectural history, social
                    history, Islamic studies, music history, archaeology, the
                    history of science, food history and conservation. Exploring
                    the domestic interior in Italy between 1400 and 1600 in all
                    its visual and material complexity, with objects ranging
                    from prestigious old master paintings and sculpture to pins
                    and pastry cutters, the exhibition brought together for the
                    first time the world of Renaissance âhighâ art and that of
                    domestic material culture. Engaging with household life and
                    everyday experience as well as cultural forms, the
                    exhibition addressed topics as wide ranging as cooking and
                    dining, marriage and childbirth rituals, gambling,
                    music-making, health and hygiene, collecting and
                    mathematical knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The project aimed to make a major new contribution to
                    Renaissance studies and to give revived meaning to the
                    outstanding Renaissance collections housed within the
                    V&amp;A.To achieve these objectives the project maximized
                    its investment in original research by focusing on a wide
                    variety of largely unpublished written documents, visual
                    sources and objects. From domestic inventories to cookery
                    books, from celebrated family portraits to popular prints,
                    from ancient gems to chamber pots, the exhibition revealed a
                    new, multi-faceted aspect to Renaissance art and culture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The multiplicity of research methods and exhibits involved
                    in the project was reflected in the narratives accompanying
                    the display, based directly on primary sources, which
                    suggested different, often contrasting interpretations of
                    the same objects. Replacing the traditional authoritative
                    curatorial voice with a more challenging and active
                    approach, this mode of display aimed at including the viewer
                    creatively in the meaning-making process and encouraging a
                    dialogue between specialists and a wider audience.This
                    curatorial strategy meant that there was a direct continuity
                    from the initial framing of research questions all the way
                    to the labels read by members of the public.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much recent debate has highlighted the widespread
                    dissatisfaction with traditional arenas of social and
                    cultural exchange and the need for alternative spaces for
                    public discourse. As public events and experiences playing a
                    role in the creation of shared meaning, exhibitions can be
                    seen as a largely untapped force for debate and social
                    cohesion. Exhibitions such as âAt Home in Renaissance Italyâ
                    can respond to this demand for public engagement with
                    culture in different ways. By presenting historical
                    materials in an exciting and accessible form they can help
                    to bridge the gap between past and present. By revealing
                    everyday objects, stories or situations that resonate with
                    the life experience of the viewer they can appeal to wider
                    cross-sections of society. By addressing complexity and
                    difference head-on, challenging commonly held assumptions
                    and establishing a dynamic relationship with the viewer,
                    they can provide potent evidence of the value of investing
                    in research into the arts and the humanities.

                  <h3>iv. Creativity and design practice</h3>
                  <p>
                    Museum-based arts and humanities research also capitalises
                    on and creates multiple connections within the creative
                    industries, making links between practitioners including
                    fine artists, graphic, fashion and 3D designers and
                    craftspeople; manufacturers; scientists; retailers;
                    educators; journalists, publishers and media producers. It
                    encourages debate and collaboration across discrete sectors
                    to their collective benefit and offers an inspirational
                    space in which national conversations about creative skills
                    can take place. In the case of the V&amp;A, research
                    projects focusing on fashion have been particularly
                    successful in generating productive dialogue about this
                    high-profile, multi-million pound industry and its economic,
                    cultural and political meanings and impact.

                    The âShopping Routes: Networks of Fashion Consumption in
                    Londonâs West End 1945 â 1979â project was one such
                    initiative. Jointly hosted by the Geography Department at
                    Royal Holloway, University of London, London College of
                    Fashion and the V&amp;A between 2003 and 2006 as part of the
                    ESRC/AHRCCultures of Consumption Programme, the project had
                    the central aim of providing a new critical history of the
                    development of the West End in the post-war period; widening
                    and complicating existing assumptions, particularly those
                    associated with the powerful myth of âSwinging London.â The
                    project had a series of focused research objectives, seeking
                    to provide an account of the interfaces between designers,
                    manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, urban planners and
                    consumers in the city. It also sought to develop recent
                    ideas about the spatial contexts of fashion consumption,
                    especially those situated in major metropolises, and to
                    enhance understandings of consumption-led processes of urban
                    renewal and transformation. It had the wider aim of
                    interpreting Londonâs role as a major fashion city in a
                    comparative context, by examining the development of a range
                    of key global sites of fashion consumption within a longer
                    time-frame.

                    Through a combination of cross-institutional and
                    multi-disciplinary approaches, the research succeeded in
                    providing a much more nuanced and extensive history of a
                    phenomenon that hitherto has generally been approached
                    through nostalgic accounts that focused on over-familiar
                    sites like Carnaby Street and the Kingâs Road, and on the
                    emergent celebrity culture of the 1960s. It achieved this in
                    a number of ways. First, archival research pointed to the
                    significance of long-term features of Londonâs fashion
                    landscape, situating the seemingly overnight transformation
                    of the city in the mid-1960s in the context of existing
                    structures of retailing, wholesale, promotion and consumer
                    behaviour, some of which had their roots in the
                    mid-nineteenth century. Secondly, it challenged the existing
                    emphasis on individual designers and boutiques, in favour of
                    a framework that emphasised networks and relationships
                    across sectors and traditions, and identified fashion
                    consumptionâs interactions with other elements of urban
                    change, particularly in architecture, planning and heritage.
                    Thirdly, the project provided a systematic study of the
                    concept of the âFashion World Cityâ, placing the specific
                    characteristics of post-war London in a wider analysis of
                    fashionâs relationship with metropolitan modernity, that
                    continues to have important resonance in the present.

                  <p>
                    The results of the research were disseminated through a
                    number of channels including books and journal articles. The
                    study of fashion in world cities formed the basis for a
                    major international conference that brought together
                    academics from a wide range of disciplines, and included
                    studies of New York, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Moscow, Los
                    Angeles, Shanghai and Mumbai to complement the London focus.
                    Most importantly, in 2006 the project was responsible for a
                    high-profile exhibition on âSixties Fashionâ and an
                    associated website at the V&amp;A. This provided an
                    opportunity to test some of the research findings through an
                    engagement with the Museumâs collections, and through
                    collaboration with designers, journalists and retailers
                    active through the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Both display and
                    website, together with an exhibition book, were designed to
                    reach a broad audience and had a demonstrable effect on the
                    popular imagination, drawing positive press comment and
                    informing the content of the UK school curriculum. The
                    website also provided a way of soliciting memories of the
                    period from the public, and a means of disseminating oral
                    history interviews with key designers, entrepreneurs,
                    journalists and others involved in 1960s London.

                    In general, the project has formed part of a wider
                    re-evaluation of the political, economic and creative legacy
                    of the 1960s that has taken place in UK academic circles and
                    in the popular mediaduring the past two decades. But besides
                    providing an important platform for debate on these
                    retrospective issues, âShopping Routesâ, particularly in its
                    work on fashion and the concept of the World City, also
                    engaged with wider discussion on contemporary urban policy
                    in relation to what has been termed the New Urban Cultural
                    Economy. What this museum-centered research initiative has
                    identified is the extent to which the drive towards symbolic
                    distinctiveness by competing fashion cities needs to be
                    considered alongside the contradictory forces that stifle
                    urban individuality and creativity. These forces include the
                    hyper-capitalisation of property markets and the increasing
                    power of global corporations in a hugely expanded luxury
                    goods sector.History does have something to teach us.

                    As the content of the âSixties Fashionâ exhibition
                    suggested, connections between the new symbolic industries
                    (media and advertising) and older craft traditions were much
                    more dynamic in cities like London, New York, Milan and
                    Paris in the 1950s and 1960s, than they were after the
                    massive de-industrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. The
                    creative networks, flexible production and vibrant consumer
                    cultures of then have been replaced by the corporatised
                    surface sheen of now. So, though âSwinging Londonâ was a
                    small, local affair, its openings for new businesses, its
                    legacy of traditional fashion skills, its affordable
                    infrastructure and its innovative approach to consumerism
                    offers a genuinely distinctive template to those concerned
                    about the serious challenges faced by UK fashion
                    entrepreneurs in the globalised landscape of the early
                    twenty-first century.

                  <h3>v. The museum as a forum for cultural exchange</h3>
                  <p>
                    Besides functioning as platforms for creative reflection and
                    innovation in relation to the UKâs history and current
                    cultural and economic status, museums are also ideal venues
                    for the staging of new cultural interactions beyond national
                    frontiers. As we have suggested in reference to projects on
                    Japan, South Asia and Africa, because objects themselves
                    have always traversed national boundaries they are therefore
                    a remarkably effective way of studying historical and
                    contemporary cultural exchange. Through intelligent
                    juxtaposition, museums can encourage researchers, curators
                    and the public alike to see both difference and continuity
                    across diverse nationalities, ethnicities, and geographies.
                    This has long been a guiding principle of research at the
                    V&amp;A, and informs permanent displays such as the British
                    Galleries (opened 2001), the Jameel Gallery for Islamic Arts
                    (opened 2006), and the new Ceramics Galleries (to open
                    2009).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research for two exhibitions, on view this year at the
                    V&amp;A, exemplify this approach. âCold War Modernâ (opened
                    in the Autumn of 2008 and researched in collaboration with
                    colleagues at the University of Brighton and the Royal
                    College of Art) uses the museum platform to reconfigure
                    understandings of international relations in the recent past
                    through the prism of design. Concentrating on the highly
                    volatile years from 1945 to 1975, the exhibition will
                    examine the key themes of the period including the task of
                    reconstruction in Europe after the War and the rise of
                    consumerism, demonstrating a continuity with the themes of
                    Modernism as they emerged in the inter-war years (explored
                    in the V&amp;Aâs âModernism: Designing a New Worldâ
                    exhibition of 2006). The strong influence of the Cold War
                    upon popular culture will be shown through graphics,
                    fashion, film, and product design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than focusing exclusively on the two superpowers that
                    formed the poles of Cold War politics (the USA and USSR),
                    the exhibition looks at countries such as Italy, France,
                    Poland and Czechoslovakia, all of which were shaped by the
                    eraâs politics but were not necessarily able to dictate
                    them. The recovery of design history from these contexts
                    unveils complex lines of stylistic and technological
                    exchange. The Soviet satellites of the Eastern Bloc, for
                    example, experimented with surprising intersections between
                    modernism and ideology. Across the projectâs wide geography,
                    art and design during this period played a central role in
                    representing, and sometimes challenging, the dominant ideas
                    of the age.

                  <p>
                    âChina Design Nowâ, on view at the V&amp;A during the Spring
                    of 2008, was an even more clear-cut example of the Museum as
                    a forum for cultural debate and exchange and a vehicle for
                    truly original research. Based on extensive curatorial
                    field-work carried out in Shenzhen, Shanghai and&nbsp;Beijing
                    over a period of four years, and a three-day research
                    workshop held at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing
                    in 2006, the exhibition provided a snapshot of the last ten
                    years of rapid change in Chinaâs creative industries.
                    Despite considerable recent media coverage in the UK (partly
                    due to the upcoming Olympics in Beijing), public
                    understanding of the social and industrial transformations
                    occurring in China is only just starting to take shape. In
                    such a moment there is no substitute for on-the-ground
                    research, and this the V&amp;A has been able to provide
                    in-depth, bringing examples of product, fashion,
                    architectural and graphic design before the British public
                    for the first time. In addition, âChina Design Nowâ offered
                    insights into the dynamics of emergent design
                    professionalism â and thus offers lessons that might well be
                    applied to the study of other places and times.

                  <h2>Concluding comments</h2>
                  <p>
                    These various case studies demonstrate the vibrancy of arts
                    and humanities research undertaken within just one national
                    institution; many othersimilar examples could be cited from
                    the activities of the V&amp;A, and more broadly across the
                    British museum and gallery sector. What positions
                    inter-disciplinary museum-based research in the UK as unique
                    is its innovative focus on material and visual culture as a
                    primary focus for explaining broader cultural, aesthetic,
                    economic and political developments; its openness to
                    cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary research as a
                    means of formulating such explanations; and its
                    extraordinary capacity to further specialist knowledge
                    whilst also informing wider public understanding. There is
                    of course much potential for strengthening the research-base
                    of the UKâs museum sector, not least through further
                    research that demonstrates the essential link between
                    grounded, scholarly investigation of collections and the
                    experience of the visitor. All must agree however, that the
                    simplistic dismissal of museum outputs as âdumbed-downâ
                    versions of academic research â spectacular but empty
                    entertainment â overlooks the tremendous innovation that
                    underlies museum work in the UK today. This research
                    constitutes an example to our international peers, and a
                    major contribution to the intellectual and cultural life of
                    the nation.
