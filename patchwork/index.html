                    There is a longstanding affiliation between confinement and
                    creativity. While restricting the movement of the human
                    form, prisons, workhouses, internment camps, hospitals and
                    asylums have long been the site of great imagination and
                    industry. Nineteenth-century Parisian prisons promoted
                    furniture-making, while in the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth century, British officials in India installed
                    looms in several prisons to produce carpets and
                    textiles.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></strong>
                    In 2010 a V&amp;A exhibition will place examples of over 300
                    years of British quilting and patchwork within their
                    historical and social contexts. It will include the 1841
                    âRajah Quiltâ, the only known transportation quilt in a
                    public collection, and a newly commissioned collaboration
                    with the charity Fine Cell Work, designed and made by the
                    inmates of HMP Wandsworth.

                    All of the objects in the exhibition will provide evidence
                    of the ways in which individual makers have responded to
                    their environment, not least in the case of those makers who
                    are working within the unique surroundings of the prison.
                    This paper will focus on the particular work of Elizabeth
                    Fry as a prison reformer in the nineteenth century, her
                    connection to the Rajah Quilt, and offer a consideration of
                    the HMP Wandsworth commission in the light of this history.

                  <h2>Elizabeth Fry and the British prison system</h2>
                  <p>
                    The use of confinement as a punishment for crime is a
                    relatively new concept, and one closely tied to the
                    transportation of convicted felons: a process that started
                    in the eighteenth century and continued for over 200
                    years.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup></strong>
                    The largest movements were to America in the eighteenth
                    century, and then to Australia in the nineteenth
                    century.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    Although the actual punishment was a term of hard labour,
                    many of the earliest prisons were developed as collection
                    points for those awaiting trial or transportation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup></strong>
                    In these early prisons, no distinctions were made between
                    prisoners who might be awaiting trial, debtors, and
                    convicted felons. Furthermore, there was no classification
                    of prisoners based on sex or age.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></strong>
                    Conditions were summarised by the reformer John Howard in
                    âThe State of the Prisons in England and Walesâ as âfilthy,
                    corrupt-ridden and unhealthyâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the first three decades of the nineteenth
                    century, Britain witnessed the growth of reformatory theory
                    as a basis for prison discipline, and an increasing interest
                    in rehabilitation initiatives.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup></strong>
                    Texts on the subject of prison reform circulated within
                    society, many of which were characterised by both moral
                    fervour and first-hand accounts of prison conditions.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup></strong>
                    In particular, the reformer Elizabeth Fry started to stress
                    the humanitarian needs and rehabilitative potential of
                    prisoners, propagating the benefits of social mobility and
                    improvement in the wake of years of punishment and
                    retribution. Fry was born in Norwich on 21 May 1780. She was
                    raised in a Quaker household, and became a minister and
                    preacher for the Society of Friends in 1810. Her interest in
                    prison conditions began after visiting Newgate Prison in
                    1813 and witnessing the living conditions of women and
                    children.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fryâs particular focus was the improvement of conditions for
                    women inmates. Her reform methods involved the establishment
                    of several ladies committees: small groups of women who
                    visited prisons on a regular basis to work directly with
                    inmates, often taking food and clothing with them, but
                    predominantly offering teaching and guidance. In 1821 Fry
                    formed the British Ladies Society for the Reformation of
                    Female Prisoners, which formalised the opportunity for women
                    outside the prison to identify with members of their own sex
                    and offer aid and instruction where possible.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup></strong>
                    The women of the Ladies Society donated sewing supplies
                    which included tape, ten yards of fabric, four balls of
                    white cotton sewing thread, a ball each of black, red and
                    blue thread, black wool, twenty-four hanks of coloured
                    thread, a thimble, one hundred needles, threads, pins,
                    scissors and two pounds of patchwork pieces (or almost ten
                    metres of fabric).<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fryâs jurisdiction aimed to replace the primacy of
                    punishment, violence and repression used to regulate social
                    relationships with a pastoral model encouraging education
                    and rehabilitation, affiliation and empathy:<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup></strong>

                      common claim on the pity and attention of those of her own
                      sex, who, through the bounty of a kind Providence, are
                      able to do good.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    These comments respect a community consciousness shared
                    between women at various levels of society. Fryâs subsequent
                    observations emphasise the importance of providing adequate
                    education and instruction during a period of incarceration,
                    in the understanding that this would lead to a pattern of
                    behaviour desirable during social reintegration. Annemieke
                    van Drenth and Francisca de Haan have suggested that this
                    aspect of Fryâs work can be seen as a secularised variation
                    of the pastoral care developed in the traditions of
                    Christianity and Quakerism.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup></strong>
                    Adopting a stricter form of Quakerism in 1799, Fryâs
                    fundamental belief was that divine revelation was immediate
                    and individual, terming such revelation the âinward lightâ
                    or the âinner lightâ. Fryâs Quakerism rejected a formal
                    creed and stressed inward contemplation as the route to
                    salvation.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup></strong>&nbsp;Needlework can be seen as a tool which offered not only a
                    practical skill, but also an enlightened state of
                    contemplation, whereby the focus required for the act of
                    stitching would have allowed the maker to enter a mental
                    space removed from the everyday.

                    There are numerous objects in public collections that
                    testify to the therapeutic value attached to the needle, but
                    less research has been carried out on the particular choice
                    of patchwork as a tool of reform.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></strong>
                    Fry herself was keen to highlight patchwork as an excellent
                    choice for the women of Newgate:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      âFormerly, patchwork occupied much of the time of the
                      women confined to Newgate, as it still does that of the
                      female convicts on the voyage to New South Wales. It is an
                      exceptional mode of employing the women, if no other work
                      can be procured for them, and is useful as a means for
                      teaching them the art of sewing.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup></strong>
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Fry draws a subtle distinction here between patchwork and
                    other forms of needlework. While patchwork is useful as an
                    instructional tool (something that the sampler excelled at),
                    it is exceptional in employing and occupying the women. The
                    creation of intricate patchwork required a heavy investment
                    of time. With a lack of active employment, the experience of
                    prison life for many in the early nineteenth century was
                    reduced to the soul-destroying slippage of hours into days.
                    Fry was keen to instil in the prisoner the transformative
                    potential of this experience, turning simply âdoing timeâ
                    into the positive experience of having the time in which to
                    do something, and restoring a sense of control and
                    independence to the inmate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Integral to the success of Fryâs scheme was attaching value
                    to this time spent: the union of a creative agenda with
                    financial remuneration for the âindustriesâ carried out by
                    the female inmates. These plans were initially resisted:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      âObjections have been made, by some persons, to the
                      employment of prisoners, on the ground that it may be the
                      means of depriving some of the industrious poor of the
                      means of an honest and respectable maintenance.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup></strong>
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    However, Fry sought to persuade prison authorities of the
                    motivational benefits of paid employment.
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>
                      âIt is to be hoped, however, that such objections will,
                      ere long, cease to be urged; for it is abundantly evident,
                      that unless the time of these poor females, who have
                      abandoned themselves to idleness and vice, be fully
                      occupied while they are in prison, there can be little or
                      no hope that their confinement will lead to their
                      reformation. Without this important aid to prison
                      discipline, their attention will still be directed to the
                      criminal objects which have previously occupied them, and
                      much of their time will probably be spent in contriving
                      plans for future evil. We cannot promote the reformation
                      of such persons more effectively than by making them
                      experimentally acquainted with the fruits of industry â¦
                      Some remuneration for their work, even during their
                      continuance in confinement, will be found to act as a
                      powerful stimulus to a powerful and persevering
                      industry.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup></strong>

                    Fryâs appeal was successful, and set a precedent for
                    contemporary needlework initiatives.

                    Fry was not alone in advocating the necessity of financial
                    remuneration for those who took up needlework within the
                    prison. John Francis Maguire was the Mayor of Cork in 1852.
                    In the wake of Irelandâs National Exhibition of the same
                    year, and the successful display of several prison quilts\
                    he published a text which aimed to highlight âthe advantages
                    of industrial employment in public institutions, especially
                    those intended for purposes of reformationâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup></strong>

                      the country, a place of punishment, rather than of
                      reformation. Despite the zeal of the Governor and the
                      solicitude of the chaplains, it very rarely happened that
                      any unhappy creature out of the many thousands committed

                    While a âselect fewâ of the prison population were employed
                    in âindustrial occupationâ (making clothes and carrying out
                    some daily prison duties), it was not until 1847 that a
                    stronger campaign for rehabilitation was put into place:

                      oakum-picking and stone-breaking, the two grand specifics

                    The result, according to the author, was âthe good order of

                    The emphasis here is on active employment, aimed to improve
                    the inmateâs well-being, social interaction within the
                    prison, and the likelihood of rehabilitation upon release.
                    Maguire highlights the potential of the prison to act as an
                    educational and reformatory institution, propagating a
                    familiarity with the production of goods and the world of
                    trade. The eventual display of the Cork Gaol quilts in the
                    National Exhibition of 1852 implies that Maguire was
                    effective in engaging the inmates with the wider industrial
                    economy (and the associated principles of spectacle,
                    commerce and display), despite their confinement. His
                    terminology of redemption and elevation is also reflective
                    of Fryâs socio-religious discourse, suggesting mental focus
                    as the routes to salvation. These approaches stress the
                    prison as a rehabilitative rather than punitive environment,
                    forwarding the needle as one of the primary tools of utility
                    and reform.

                  <h2>The Rajah quilt</h2>
                  <p>
                    Fryâs extensive accounts and diaries offer an insight into
                    the use of needlework in prisons in the nineteenth century,
                    but today there is relatively little testimony available
                    from the convicts with whom she worked. Often this
                    information is bound up in the objects that the prisoners
                    created. One such object is the only known transportation
                    quilt in a public collection; the Rajah Quilt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1841, patchwork provisions were carried on board the
                    Rajah, to be used by some of the 180 women prisoners on
                    board. The ship left Woolwich on 5th April and arrived in
                    Hobart, Van Diemenâs Land (present day Tasmania) on 19th
                    July with 179 women prisoners, and it is thought that up to
                    twenty-nine convict women may have worked the quilt.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The quilt was acquired in 1989 by the National Gallery of
                    Australia, who believe that it may have been produced under
                    the guidance of Miss Keiza Hayter.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup></strong>
                    Hayter had worked at the Millbank Penitentiary, and was
                    given free passage on board in the understanding that she
                    dedicated her time to the improvement of the prisoners. On
                    the recommendation of Fry, Hayter joined the journey to Van
                    Diemenâs Land to assist Lady Franklin in the formation of
                    the Tasmanian Ladiesâ Society for the Reformation of Female
                    Prisoners.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup></strong>
                    The message inscribed on the quilt suggests that Hayter may
                    have continued the educational practices of the Ladies
                    Society,

                  <p>
                    The quilt suggests a desire to enter into the processes of
                    creation and renewal beyond the instructive space of the
                    prison, while also paying homage to the patronage of the
                    Ladies Committee. The quilt was intended to travel back to
                    Britain as a gift, documenting the safe passage of both the
                    female convicts and Fryâs message to the shores of Van
                    Diemenâs Land. Whether or not Fry saw it before her death is
                    unknown, but it also spoke to a wider audience about the
                    âfruits of industryâ, claiming the relevance of Fryâs
                    message beyond the walls of Newgate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The quilt measures 325 Ã 337 centimetres. It is designed
                    with a central square of Broderie Perse (appliquÃ©d chintz),
                    with twelve frames radiating outwards to form a medallion
                    quilt (a patchwork quilt with a central panel framed by
                    multiple borders).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Broderie Perse coverlets seem to have been particularly
                    popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.
                    Two examples are now held by the V&amp;A, and are thought to
                    date from the first half of the nineteenth century. The
                    first (V&amp;A museum no: T.382-1960) is a white cotton
                    coverlet, appliquÃ©d with block-printed chintzes. The central
                    panel contains a peacock, and the frame surrounding this is
                    divided into smaller square compartments containing flowers,
                    Chinese vases and other Chinoiserie motifs (such as birds,
                    trees and small figures in Chinese dress). The outer border
                    of the quilt has a bright red ground printed in black with a
                    classical design of urns, and an eagle and lyre design. Work
                    undertaken at the Museum by Barbara Morris at the time of
                    acquisition dates the textiles, many of which were printed
                    at Bannister Hall near Preston, to between 1804 and 1811.
                    The red and black âclassicalâ border was printed for George
                    Anstey, a leading London linen-draper, in 1804. The Chinese
                    vases come from two fabrics printed at Bannister Hall in
                    1805 and 1806. Family history undertaken by the donor
                    suggests that the quilt may have been made for an affluent
                    Lancashire family between 1811 and 1815.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second relevant coverlet in the collection dates from
                    around 1820, and shows a variety of printed cottons
                    appliquÃ©d on a white linen ground (V&amp;A museum no:
                    T.399-1970). The appliquÃ©d prints are mostly flowers, but
                    brightly coloured block printed birds have also been used on
                    the outer border. These fashionable coverlets display the
                    freedom to choose the textiles for the benefit of the
                    design, declaring the householdâs access to luxury goods.
                    The Rajah Quilt similarly draws on the popularity of
                    Broderie Perse as a technique, and the desirability of
                    printed cotton chintzes.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup></strong>
                    Carolyn Ferguson has undertaken detailed research on the
                    Rajah Quilt for the Quilterâs Guild of the British Isles,
                    and suggests that although it is extremely difficult to say
                    where the fabrics were acquired from, it is likely that the
                    ladies of the Convict Ship Committee would have sourced them
                    from the Manchester merchants operating from warehouses in
                    the Cheapside area of London.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup></strong>
                    In particular, Ferguson suggests that the four birds shown
                    on the central panel connect to the printed cottons produced
                    in Manchester, such as those inspired by the prints of John
                    Potts.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup></strong>
                    Such printed cottons would have provided a visual reference
                    to the world of trade and commerce, connecting these women
                    to a cross-section of contemporary textile technologies and
                    markets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also important to note that the Rajah Quilt was not a
                    singular example of patchwork created during transportation
                    although, as discussed, it is the only known example in a
                    public collection. As Ferguson notes, a convict on board the
                    âBrotherâ (1823) sent Fry a calabash as a gift and recorded
                    that she used the patchwork quilt she had made on her bed,
                    while Surgeon Wilson on the Princess Royal reported that
                    many of the women made patchwork quilts and some of them
                    were left behind on the ship.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup></strong>
                    Furthermore, in âThe Fatal Shoreâ, Robert Hughes describes a
                    court scene enacted by convicts on deck for the purposes of
                    entertainment; âcathartic parodies in which the âjudgeâ,
                    robed in a patchwork quilt with a swab combed over his head
                    for a wig, his face made up with red-lead, chalk and
                    stove-backing, would volley denunciations at the cowering
                    âprisonerâ.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup></strong>
                    Hughes also describes the appearance of the great hulls as
                    vast floating âstreet tenementsâ, with âlines of bedding
                    strung out to air between the stumps of the mastsâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup></strong>
                    These accounts suggest the presence of patchwork on the
                    visual landscape of the ship, integrated into performances
                    and part of the daily routine of the convict. Each surviving
                    quilt acts as a vessel for its respective narrative,
                    testifying to the convictâs endurance of their journey and
                    the handing down of individual accounts of life at
                    sea.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup></strong>

                  <h2>The Fine Cell Work commission</h2>
                  <p>
                    The recent Fine Cell Work commission for the V&amp;A engages
                    with this complex history of patchwork produced during
                    confinement. Fine Cell Work is a Registered Charity that
                    teaches needlework to prison inmates. It is based on the
                    vision of Lady Anne Tree, a longstanding prison visitor,
                    entertainments officer at HMP Wandsworth and a prison
                    inspector who continues to support and guide the charity.
                    Fine Cell Work operates through a philanthropic model that
                    reflects Elizabeth Fryâs emphasis on community
                    consciousness. Volunteers work with small groups (of around
                    eleven or twelve) inmates, teaching various needlework
                    skills. Quilting and patchwork skills are taught to all-male
                    groups at HMP Wandsworth. Prisoners involved with the
                    charity carry out their needlework while confined to their
                    cells. Once trained, inmates can be responsible for
                    difficult commissions and support other inmates who are
                    still learning. As one of the inmates enrolled on the scheme
                    points out, one of the benefits of this structure is that it
                    âis more consistent and reliable than say education classes
                    because you can do it when you want and in your own time.
                    You can learn from other people.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup></strong>
                    The act of stitching allows the maker to reclaim time as his
                    own. In an environment of finite choices and extensive
                    periods of isolation, this allows the maker to transform
                    hours of confinement into a period of productivity and
                    creativity. At the centre of the Fine Cell Works ethos sits
                    this notion of the individual inmate: the creator, producer
                    and stitcher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Integral to the success of the charity is the fostering of a
                    sub-culture within the prison that returns to the basic
                    principles of Elizabeth Fryâs reforms: the fruitful
                    relationship between creativity and industry. Prisoners are
                    paid for their work. This âgenerates skills and
                    independence, while also allowing them to save for their
                    releaseâ, hence reducing the likelihood of a return to
                    crime.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup></strong>
                    Prisoners often send the money that they earn from Fine Cell

                    They also develop a skills base that may be useful to them
                    beyond the prison gates. This includes not only the
                    practical aspects of stitching, but also engagement with
                    design initiatives, working to project deadlines and
                    collaborative interaction with the volunteers who instruct
                    them.

                    The footprint of the V&amp;A commission is based on the
                    Panoptican design of Wandsworth Prison. The quilt will be
                    sewn and designed by inmates across the prison estate,
                    supported by V&amp;A Curator Sue Prichard. The project
                    appears in the wake of several collaborative initiatives
                    between museums and prison charities seeking to reduce the
                    number of inmates who re-offend. In 2006, the Museum of
                    London curated the âMindâs Eyeâ, featuring twenty-five
                    paintings and fourteen pieces of creative writing by inmates
                    of HMP Wandsworth. Working in collaboration with
                    professional artists and writers, the inmates offered
                    remembrances of London following a series of workshops with
                    artists and writers.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup></strong>
                    The exhibition was part of a three-year programme supported
                    by the Heritage Lottery Fund to engage people at risk of
                    social exclusion with their heritage.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup></strong>

                    Prior to this, the âBlack Boxâ project (2002â03) involved
                    museums and galleries in East and West Sussex working with
                    prisoners from Ford Prison in Arundel, âto create personal
                    museums of the imaginationâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup></strong>
                    Participants were invited to take part in a series of
                    workshops led by poets and supported by museum staff and
                    artists. Inspired by artefacts brought in from museum
                    collections, they worked âonly with images and
                    wordsâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup></strong>
                    Participants were encouraged to organise and interpret an
                    imaginary space, dividing it into separate âroomsâ to house
                    âsignificant, precious and hated thingsâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup></strong>
                    The project was funded by the MLA South East (Museums,
                    Libraries and Archives), with the aim of engaging âhard to
                    reachâ audiences with local collections. The MLA also funded
                    and supported âProject Heroâ during the same period,
                    described as âcreative reader and writer development courses
                    around graphic novels and artefacts for young offenders who
                    were disaffected with educationâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup></strong>
                    The Museum of Reading and Readingâs Prison Library worked
                    with young men in the Separated Prisoners Unit at HM Young
                    Offenders Institute, Reading. External evaluation suggests
                    that the pilot project âraised the young menâs self esteem
                    and enhanced their key skills in literacy, creativity,
                    communication and social interactionâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup></strong>
                    Since 2003, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has been
                    working with a number of prisons throughout England on the
                    âVirtual Egyptâ project.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup></strong>
                    Sally-Ann Ashton, a specialist in Egyptology, has been
                    collaborating with prisoners and prison education
                    departments to develop educational resources (in particular,
                    a virtual walk through of the recently refurbished Egyptian
                    galleries). The resulting material will be used for project
                    work in prisons, and also as a public resource. The project
                    combines âspecialist knowledge with specific cultural
                    experiences to provide learning opportunities and
                    methodologies adapted to those unable to visit museums but
                    of value for much wider applicationâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthering the potential of projects that bring together
                    design-led and social rehabilitation initiatives, a recent
                    exhibition entitled âThe Creative Prisonâ explored the ways
                    in which contemporary architecture could offer solutions to
                    current prison conditions.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup></strong>
                    The project was developed by architect Will Alsop, artists
                    Shona Illingworth and Jon Ford, and led by the arts
                    organisation Rideout (Creative Arts for Rehabilitation).
                    Collaborating with the staff and inmates of HMP Gartree,
                    Leicestershire, âThe Creative Prisonâ examined how the
                    design of prisons âinforms their effectiveness and
                    challenges attitudes to current prisoner
                    rehabilitationâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup></strong>
                    The resulting development of an imaginary prison suggested
                    the ways in which architecture could improve safety,
                    interaction and educational activity. It also encouraged
                    prisoners to think proactively about the theme of
                    rehabilitation through film and sculpture.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In all instances, the emphasis has been on engaging the
                    prisoners with their personal and collective memories,
                    particularly in relation to museum collections, while also
                    increasing their skills base and encouraging a proactive
                    approach to reintegration into the community. The V&amp;A
                    and Fine Cell Work collaboration continues in this vein. The
                    emphasis of the project is on creative expression, personal
                    reflection and community, centred on the act of bringing the
                    participants together to quilt and share their experiences.
                    Recent feedback from stitchers suggests that the resulting
                    acts of communal discourse reinvigorate the prison
                    environment as a site of creative energy. One participant
                    commented on his enjoyment of quilting âwith so many
                    different peopleâ, recognising that âeach has their own
                    perspectiveâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup></strong>
                    For this individual, the act of quilting represents the
                    opportunity to forge links with fellow prisoners:

                      âIt gives you a purpose to relate to other people. Itâs
                      difficult talking to strangers but if you can do it with a
                      reason it helps. You get more sociable because youâre
                      chasing people for materials! â¦ You can learn from other
                      people and teach them something as well. You feel youâve
                      advanced your knowledge and experience.â<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup></strong>

                  <p>
                    Large periods of confinement restrict each prisonerâs
                    opportunity to share and attain knowledge and skills, but
                    the co-operative act of creating the quilt engenders a
                    dialogue focused on acts of progression and knowledge.

                  <p>
                    Each prisoner involved with the commission has the
                    opportunity to design and stitch their own hexagon, which
                    will then be pieced into the larger template of the quilt.
                    Hexagons already completed by prisoners demonstrate a clear
                    conversation with both the history of the British prison
                    system and contemporary discourses on trade and authority.
                    Moving away from the submissive tone and general acceptance
                    present in the inscription of the Rajah Quilt, the HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt offers a critical engagement with the
                    system in which the prisoner is encased. The following
                    design displays the longstanding association between labour
                    and prison life.

                    The overbearing hand of authority (Figure 1) dominates the
                    physical landscape, overtly referencing the hard and
                    monotonous prison tasks of marching and rock-breaking
                    promoted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
                    as punishing/suitableforms of employment for prisoners.

                  <p>
                    In placing the hand in plain view, the stitcher also
                    encourages a contemplation of the absolute importance of the
                    hand in the life of the prisoner (both metaphorically in the
                    hand of authority, and literally as the tool of salvation
                    for the stitcher). Many of the hexagons return us to the
                    image of the hand or the physical impression left by it.

                    Here (fig. 2), a fingerprint is surrounded by borders of
                    DNA, references the heightened interest in the scientific
                    identification of the criminal (through fingerprinting and
                    recent developments in forensics). It also suggests wider
                    discourses on personal freedom, and government initiatives
                    to introduce tighter forms of identification.

                  <p>
                    Other hexagons (fig. 3) engage directly with the action of
                    the probation board, and return us to the process of
                    stitching by bringing the needle and thread to the

                      he had helped me with cigarette papers and teabags. He
                      explained how heâd broken his glasses and needed to finish
                      a pattern he was sewing for the in-cell charity course.
                      Although I class myself as being very butch and sewing so
                      very feminine, I figured I owed him, so I agreed to help
                      him finish his work. He showed me what it was I had to do,
                      I made him promise not to tell anybody and I hid it in a
                      cupboard in my cell. About nine oâclock I got it out and
                      started sewing. Before I knew where I was they started
                      unlocking us for breakfast, a whole night had come and
                      gone with no thoughts of suicide, and no tears of
                      melancholy.

                    For this individual who perceives himself emotionally and
                    physically trapped, the needle offers focus and purpose, and
                    the possibility of mental âescapeâ from the monotony of
                    prison life. Initially ashamed of engaging in what he
                    perceives as gendered work, the prisoner develops a strong
                    sense of fulfilment and achievement based on the act of
                    stitching.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of the Fine Cell Work stitchers acknowledge not only
                    the reassuring rhythmic repetition of the act of sewing, but
                    also the cultural meaning attached to the objects that they
                    produce. There is often a great poignancy for participants
                    in offering up their own time and designs for public
                    consumption, and the realisation that something important to
                    them is appreciated by the rest of society. A prisonerâs
                    comment that âweâre like a forgotten communityâ acknowledges
                    the shared experiences of those within the prison walls, but
                    also the strong sense of alienation that comes into being
                    when entering or leaving the prison gates.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup></strong>
                    For this reason, the Fine Cell Work participants sew in the
                    knowledge that the HMP Wandsworth Quilt will be on view in a
                    public exhibition in 2010, striking a connection between the
                    exhibition audience and the prisoners who helped to create
                    it. As part of the permanent collections at the V&amp;A, it
                    will also form a lasting legacy for these men, tying
                    together personal memories to form a collective document of
                    prison life as it stands in 2010.

                    In dialogue with the Rajah Quilt, it is hoped that the HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt will encourage an understanding of quilts
                    as part of a hybrid history of creative practice. The HMP
                    Wandsworth Quilt both resonates with the complexity of this
                    history, remembering the skills and experiences of past
                    prisoners, and explores the continuing relevance of the
                    prison as a site of creativity.

                          Between 1718 and 1775 around 30,000 convicts were
                          transported to the West Indies and North America for
                          periods of between seven and fourteen years. From
                          1787, around 160,000 convicts were transported to
                          Australia over a period of 80 years. See Nick Flynn

                          When transportation to the American colonies was
                          interrupted in 1776 by the American War of
                          Independence, old sailing ships known as âhulksâ had
                          to be brought into use on the Thames. In 1779 an Act
                          introduced a new concept of hard labour for prisoners
                          in the hulks, commencing with dredging the river
                          Thames, and made provision for the building of two
                          penitentiaries. There was considerable delay in
                          building these institutions. Transportation to
                          Australia became possible in 1787, thus relieving the
                          pressure on the hulks, so it was not until 1816 that
                          construction of convict prisons commenced. Hulks
                          continued to be used until 1859 and at one time
                          contained 70,000 prisoners, many being French
                          prisoners of war captured after the defeat of
                          Napoleon. See Amy Edwards, âHome Office: 1782â1982â

                          abolition of slavery. See Annemieke van Drenth and

                          For example, the V&amp;A holds a sampler stitched by
                          Elizabeth Parker. The sampler tells the story of its
                          maker in red stitches on a neutral ground. She
                          describes her family, the violence and âcrueltyâ that
                          she encounters when she enters into service at the age
                          of thirteen, and her thoughts on taking her own life.
                          The narrative ends ambiguously, with Elizabeth
                          contemplating âwhat will become of my soulâ. For

                          The later examples of the Changi quilts, created by
                          women in the internment camps after the surrender of
                          Singapore to Japanese troops in 1942, affirm the close
                          affiliation between quilting and systems of
                          communication. Although these women were prisoners of
                          war rather than convicts, each patch communicates the
                          survival of a woman, her endurance, her time passed,
                          and her refusal to disappear from the visual
                          landscape. One of these quilts is now held by the
                          British Red Cross Museum in London. See

                          Ibid. Government statistics suggest that six out of
                          ten prisoners reoffend with two years of their
                          release, and economic pressures are often cited as one
                          of the main reasons. Recent policy documents such as

                          (2005) and âReducing Re-Offending Through Skills and

                          and learning can contribute to this goal. These

                          suggests its high success rate. Of the 15 inmates who
                          started the project, 11 completed the course. The
                          weekly attendance rate was 86%, and 50% of those who
                          completed an evaluation for the Museum of London said
                          that they had acquired useful knowledge or skills âto
                          a high extentâ, while the same proportion said they
                          had done so âto a good extentâ. See Liza Ramrayka,
