                    The Oliver Messel Collection consists of around 10,000
                    individual items and has been housed by the V&amp;A Theatre
                    Collections since 1981. The collection was originally on
                    loan from Lord Snowdon, Messelâs nephew, who inherited the
                    collection on his uncleâs death in 1978. In 1983 the V&amp;A
                    held a major exhibition using the Messel collection as the
                    source material and including many objects on loan from his
                    family, friends and work colleagues, including his sister
                    Anne (Lady Rosse) and his nephew, Thomas Messel.

                    Fund, the V&amp;A Theatre Collections purchased the
                    collection from Lord Snowdon. Under the funding agreement,
                    the V&amp;A established a touring interactive display using
                    the collection as an inspiration. The Museum also staged a

                    and Messelâs nephew, Thomas, gave papers on Messelâs legacy
                    as an interior, film and stage designer.

                  <h2>Oliver Messel (1904 â 1978)</h2>
                  <p>
                    <strong>âI attempted to use every device to make as much magic as
                      possibleâ. Oliver Messel.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Oliver Messel was the leading British stage designer of the
                    mid-twentieth century. He was born on 13 January 1904 to
                    Maud Frances (1875 â 1960) (daughter of the Punch cartoonist
                    Edward Linley Sambourne (1844 â 1953) and Lieutenant-Colonel
                    Leonard Charles Rudolph Messel (1872 â 1953), a successful
                    banker. Messel began his fifty-year career in 1925 and won
                    international acclaim for his exquisite taste and mastery of
                    period style in revues, plays, films, interiors, buildings,
                    musicals, operas and ballets, becoming one of the most
                    sought-after and highly-paid scenery and costume designers
                    of his era.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messel was a master of illusion and make-believe; from his
                    early childhood he made model houses, furniture and painted
                    maquettes. He could make a chandelier out of sticky paper
                    and fuse-wire, or construct a dancerâs head-dress out of
                    pipe cleaners. His nephew, Lord Snowdon, remembers as a
                    child finding a birdâs nest in his London garden and on
                    inspection discovering that it had been made by his uncle
                    Oliver, and that the eggs were made of hand-painted china.

                  <p>
                    Messel was a perfectionist who knew exactly how fabric
                    should be cut and how every stage prop should be made. He
                    often demanded items be remade if they were not to his
                    satisfaction. He worked with every major theatre director of
                    his generation and received a CBE in 1958. He designed nine
                    films throughout his career, each displaying his intrinsic
                    knowledge and research for period detail and his flair for
                    creative inventiveness.

                  <p>
                    Messel had trained as a painter at the Slade School of Art
                    where his contemporaries included Rex Whistler (1905 â
                    1944). His formal studies concentrated on life drawing and
                    painting, but he also made masks from papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and wax
                    for student events. An exhibition of his masks at the
                    Claridge Galleries in London in 1925 led to his first stage
                    commission to design masks for the prestigious Diaghilev
                    ballet production of ZÃ©phyre et Flore, performed at the
                    London Coliseum. From 1926 onwards, Charles B. Cochran
                    engaged Messel to design costumes, masks and sets for his
                    annual reviews at the London Pavilion. These reviews
                    consisted of songs, sketches and chorus numbers, and
                    provided Messel with ample opportunities to develop and
                    exercise his talent for minute attention to detail,
                    inventive use of materials and imaginative pastiche of
                    historical periods and styles. This would become Messelâs
                    trademark in whatever medium he worked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1932, Messelâs white-on-white set and costume designs for
                    Helen, an opera bouffe with music by Jacques Offenbach,
                    directed by Max Reinhardt, caused a sensation on the London
                    stage. The production cemented his success and secured a
                    steady stream of prestigious London theatre design
                    commissions from the 1930s to the 1960s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was Messelâs work on Helen and the 1932 production of Max
                    Reinhardtâs wordless medieval play The Miracle that brought
                    him to the attention of film director and producer,
                    Alexander Korda. Korda was founder of London Films and
                    Denham Film studios in Buckinghamshire. He was a figurehead
                    in the fledgling British film industry and was the first
                    film director to be knighted. Messelâs first film for Korda
                    was The Private Life of Don Juan, which starred Douglas
                    Fairbanks. It was during Messelâs second film for Korda, The
                    Scarlet Pimpernel, starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon,
                    that Messel really explored the pastiching of a historical
                    period â in this case the late eighteenth century. Messel
                    was hired especially to design costumes for Oberon, who
                    would later become Kordaâs wife. The film is a romantic
                    adventure set during the French Revolution with a supporting
                    cast including Raymond Massey and Nigel Bruce. The costumes
                    for Oberon were daringly low-cut but very flattering. Messel
                    used picture hats to frame Oberonâs dark features. They were
                    fanciful and fairylike versions of the Regency period style
                    of dress and this approach to designing and creating
                    costumes would become Messelâs own distinctive style over
                    the next thirty years.

                  <h2>Romeo and Juliet (1936)</h2>
                  <p>
                    Messelâs next film project took him to Hollywood and gave
                    him the resources of a major film studio with which to
                    realise his designs in a historical film. In 1935, the
                    Hollywood film studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer was planning a
                    production of William Shakespeareâs Romeo and Juliet. Irving
                    Thalberg was Head of Production at MGM and wanted a high
                    profile production for his wife, Norma Shearer, who had been
                    off the screen for a year, having given birth to their
                    second child. Shearer was one of the most popular stars at
                    MGM during the 1930s and she had first choice of any major
                    film the studio was planning to produce. Irving, along with
                    Chief Executive Louis B. Mayer, had established MGM as the
                    most powerful film studio in the world with the famous tag
                    line âmore stars than there are in heavenâ. The studio was
                    synonymous with lavish glossy musicals, drawing-room
                    comedies and high quality literary adaptations. For
                    Shearerâs return to the screen, two high profile historical
                    projects were considered: Romeo and Juliet and Marie
                    Antoinette. Louis B. Mayer, felt the âmassesâ were not ready
                    for Shakespeare, but script problems on Marie Antoinette
                    delayed the production so Romeo and Juliet was given the
                    green light with a budget of $1,000, 000 dollars. In 1935,
                    this was the most expensive MGM production to date. George
                    Cukor, who had recently scored a hit with a screen version
                    of David Copperfield, was hired to direct.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cukor was keen for a fresh look for the film, setting it in
                    mid-Renaissance Italy. Having seen Messelâs work for The
                    Miracle in New York, he arranged for screenings of The
                    Scarlet Pimpernel and The Private Life of Don Juan for
                    Irving Thalberg and Norma Shearer. Cukor felt Messelâs
                    costumes for Merle Oberon were ornate but casual and
                    captured the essence of the period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As well as actors, writers and directors, MGM had two of the
                    most creative individuals in the history of the Hollywood
                    studio system under contract, Cedric Gibbons and Gilbert
                    Adrian (often credited on films as âGowns by Adrianâ). As
                    Head of the Art Department, Cedric Gibbons was known for his
                    Art Deco-styled set designs; his loathing of wallpapered
                    sets gave MGM productions a distinct, modern, unfussy âhouse
                    styleâ.<strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup></strong>
                    Gibbons stipulated in his contract a clause that his name
                    was put to every MGM production, regardless of whether he
                    designed it or not. Messelâs arrival from England to design
                    the film caused some initial tension at the studio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once Messel was formally engaged on the production, he was
                    dispatched with a camera crew to Italy where he spent three
                    months recording almost 3,000 photos of buildings, squares,
                    balconies, paintings, frescos and drawings. He studied the
                    paintings of Botticelli, Bellini, Carpaccio, Ghirlandaio and
                    Piero della Francesca. Gozzoliâs painting Procession of the
                    Magi, was used as an inspiration to fashion all the costumes
                    for the entrance of the Prince of Verona and his followers
                    at the beginning of the film. Norma Shearerâs costumes were
                    inspired by Fra Angelicoâs painting The Annunciation and her
                    ball gown was adapted from Michele da Veronayâs The
                    Betrothal. The level of research undertaken by Messel for
                    the film is evident in the collection held at the V&amp;A,
                    with hundreds of photographs detailing every aspect of
                    Italian imagery that would inspire the design for the film.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once back in Hollywood, Messel discovered that the studioâs
                    principal costume designer, Gilbert Adrian, had already
                    designed all the costumes, but used his charm to complete
                    what he had been hired to do. The costumes in the finished
                    film can be matched with the costume designs that are held
                    in the archive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The shoot lasted 108 days and the set covered five acres of
                    sound stages. The set department created a near
                    reconstruction of Piazza San Zeno in Verona. Romeo and
                    Juliet was one of the most intricate costuming operations in
                    MGMâs history, with more than 1,200 costumes produced for
                    the film on which 500 people worked for two months. Several
                    looms were set up in Los Angeles and two mills were engaged
                    in New York to weave tights all in one piece. A total of
                    18,000 yards of cotton, silk, satin, velvet and wool went
                    into the costumes for the extras employed to portray crowds
                    of townspeople, soldiers and nobles. One of Leslie Howardâs
                    cloaks for Romeo used nine yards of Fortuny cloth imported
                    from Italy. Norma Shearerâs costumes required one hundred
                    yards of assorted silks, satins and other materials, all
                    hand-embroidered or beaded to reproduce, as closely as
                    possible, the embroidery of the time. The âJuliet skull capâ
                    worn by Norma Shearer was a fashion hit with audiences of
                    the period. During his stay in Hollywood, Messel discovered
                    Dozianâs, a shop in Los Angeles that sold, in his words,
                    âevery kind of material ever madeâ. He bought yards of
                    unpatterned fabric, which was then hand-painted and stitched
                    in the MGM workrooms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The famous balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet was reshot
                    three times at Thalbergâs insistence (he watched the daily
                    rushes of all the films he supervised at MGM) in close-up,
                    medium and long shot and the set occupied 52,000 square feet
                    of sound stage. Many of Messelâs characteristic design
                    motifs that he would use throughout his career are visually
                    evident in the film: in the Capuletsâ ball scene, for
                    example, where Romeo first spots Juliet, ornate flowered
                    garlands hang around the high arched walls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Norma Shearer employed the English theatre actress Constance
                    Collier on the set to coach her verse delivery. Shearer, not
                    a trained actress, was extremely nervous of taking on such a
                    classical role. Her anxiety, however, was compensated with
                    generally good reviews for her performance and an Academy
                    Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was also
                    nominated in the following categories: Best Supporting Actor
                    (Basil Rathbone), Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons) and Best
                    Film (Irving Thalberg). Nevertheless, Romeo and Juliet made
                    a loss at the box office, although the studio felt that
                    films of this quality added to MGMâs prestige. Producer
                    Irving Thalberg died ten days after the Los Angeles premiere
                    of Romeo and Juliet; he was thirty-seven years old.

                    Watching the film today, the sets alternate between Messelâs
                    romantic interiors and Gibbonsâs solid, geometric rooms, and
                    the film generally lacks a certain passion, with the emotion
                    of many scenes underplayed. This is possibly due to the
                    period in which it was conceived. Later in his film career,
                    George Cukor stated that out of all his films, this was one
                    to which he would have liked to return.

                    In 1944, Messel began work on a film version of George
                    Bernard Shawâs stage play Caesar and Cleopatra. The
                    production was directed by Gabriel Pascal, who became the
                    only director trusted by Shaw to film his plays after
                    successful film versions of Pygmalion in 1938 and Major
                    Barbara in 1941.

                    The film starred Claude Rains as Caesar, Vivien Leigh as
                    Cleopatra, Stewart Granger as Apollodorus and a host of
                    strong English character actors in supporting roles. The
                    production was filmed in Technicolor, and remains the only
                    full production designed by Messel that displays his design

                    He was engaged to design costumes, props and interior
                    decoration (sets for the film were by John Bryan) and in
                    this production his talent and skill for creating objects
                    from everyday items and transforming them into something
                    ârealâ for the screen displays his versatility and
                    creativeness.

                    During the Second World War, Messel had been stationed in
                    Norwich as Camouflage Officer and it was Messelâs experience
                    of designing camouflage which would be used again in
                    designing Caesar and Cleopatra. Under the conditions of
                    wartime Britain, with strict rationing in place and many
                    shops closing down, materials required for the film were not
                    readily available. Therefore, Messel had to extend the âmake
                    do and mendâ ethos of wartime Britain into the filmâs
                    design. Many of the props required had to be created using
                    what was freely available. Authentic-looking antique
                    Egyptian jewelry was created from thin wire, plastic,
                    cellophane and bits of glass. Gold plates and ornaments were
                    made from a combination of gilded leather and papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.
                    Many of the costumes were contrived from Indian saris,
                    obtained from some of the large department stores in London
                    which where still functioning. Costume-making workshops were
                    also badly understaffed due to the essential dressmaking
                    workforce having left London due to bombing or on war
                    service.

                    Interiors, decorative hangings and bedspreads were printed
                    in hand-blocked Egyptian and Persian designs, curtains of
                    coupon-free gauze were stencilled with authentic patterns of
                    the period in specially mixed dyes. Messelâs assistants on
                    the film included Eleanor Abbey, Margaret Furse, Beatrice
                    Dawson, Arthur Boys and Matilda Etches, and the small
                    production team worked extremely long hours to sew
                    individual replica jewels onto the costumes. Messel designed
                    the fringed bed hangings in Cleopatraâs bedroom. For the
                    feathered fans used by Cleopatraâs handmaidens in the music
                    room scene, he borrowed some of the large fans from the
                    Messel family home, Nymans, in Sussex (these are now in the
                    Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).

                    Messelâs assistants were adept interpreters of Messelâs
                    artistic intentions. Hugh Skillan, who designed and created
                    many headdresses for the ballerina Margot Fonteyn, also
                    worked on the headdresses required. Materials used on one of
                    the wigs for Vivien Leigh as Cleopatra include leather, wax,
                    wire, acetate, glass, beads and paint. Finally, over 2,000
                    costumes were created for the production.

                    Caesar and Cleopatra was shot under extremely difficult
                    conditions, beginning on 12 June 1944, six days after the
                    D-Day landings. The director Gabriel Pascal wrote to George
                    Bernard Shaw on 22 June 1944 and told him:

                    âLast Saturday, I had a narrow escape on the Pharos set
                    which is built out of doors on the studio lot, when a flying
                    bomb landed and exploded 150 yards from the set in a nearby
                    field. Last night the French windows in my sitting-room were
                    blown in and the ceiling in my bedroom has cracked open
                    completely. I am having the same gay start on the picture as
                    I had with Major Barbara during the Blitz. I hope these

                    Shaw took a keen interest on almost every level of the film,
                    down to the smallest detail. Below is a sample of
                    correspondence between the two during the film:

                    âBritannus is so hopelessly wrong that he will hold up all
                    the scenes in which he appears until he is redressed. I

                    gown made for him. His wig I have had remade with red hair,

                    only for the tunic, that is why the blue overall should be

                    The sets for the film which complemented Messelâs interior
                    decoration and costumes were by John Bryan, who had designed
                    Pygmalion and Major Barbara. The ancient Memphis Palace, to
                    which Cleopatra brings Caesar after their encounter at the
                    Sphinx, was the largest interior created for the film. It
                    occupied 28, 000 square feet of floor space and each of its
                    pseudo-granite columns measured nineteen feet in diameter.

                    A twenty-seven-foot-high mini-Sphinx was created for the
                    film, and when the crew moved to Egypt for exterior shots,
                    the Sphinx was dismantled and shipped over. Once filming was
                    completed the Sphinx was left in the desert to save money on
                    transportation, where it became a photographic background

                    inventiveness, working under extraordinarily difficult
                    circumstances and the ability of his team of makers and

                    The film version of Alexander Pushkinâs
                    <em>The Queen of Spades</em> is one in a long line of
                    classic British supernatural thrillers such as
                    <em>Dead of Night</em> (1945) and
                    <em>The Innocents</em> (1961). The story is set in 1806 in
                    St Petersburg and is a Faustian tale of bargains with the
                    devil and ghostly apparitions. The film was directed by
                    Thorold Dickinson, who took over the production at only
                    three days notice. Messel was hired to design the sets and
                    costumes.

                    and it was not until the film was completed that it emerged
                    as one of Dickinsonâs finest films, with Messelâs
                    contribution to the work helping to create one of the most
                    famous British supernatural-themed films of the 1940s.

                  <p>
                    The production was filmed at Welwyn Garden City, in
                    out-of-date, cramped and badly soundproofed studios. They
                    were situated next to the main railway line so that shooting
                    had to be halted every time a train passed by. The lack of
                    space added to Messelâs headaches but he insisted on
                    designing and building the Countessâs stage coach to full
                    size and not to scale so that it could not be moved more
                    than ten feet in either direction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The budget ran out before the film was completed and
                    Dickinson was forced to improvise with some sets which were
                    constantly being torn down and replaced with new ones. In
                    addition, he was working with two performers who had never
                    made films before, Edith Evans and Yvonne Mitchell (although
                    Edith Evans had made a number of silent films, it was her
                    first âtalkingâ picture). They both found it difficult to
                    adjust to the demands of the camera after their experience
                    on the stage. Edith Evans for example, had been advised by
                    Alec Guiness to let the camera do all the work and so she
                    underplayed drastically and had to be coaxed into expanding
                    her performance. Yvonne Mitchell tended to give her best
                    performance during the first take and found herself unable
                    to repeat her initial performance in subsequent takes. The
                    script underwent numerous changes throughout the production;
                    the original prologue of the film became a flashback, and
                    sequences were cut or transposed, frequently being shot with
                    no real idea of what order they would finally appear in.
                    Under these conditions Dickinson rose to the challenge and
                    was spurred on in inventing visual techniques to drive the
                    story forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dickinson created a number of superb sequences in which he
                    uses suggestion to create terror. The visit of the young
                    Countess to the palace of St Germain is worthy of the great
                    English horror director James Whale (Frankenstein, The Bride
                    of Frankenstein). Once at the palace, the camera follows the
                    Countess down the cobwebbed corridor until she comes to a
                    huge door, which opens to reveal a gaping blackness beyond.
                    Messelâs set design for this sequence created the suggestive
                    and eerie atmosphere that Dickinson was able to replicate on
                    film.

                    The lighting of the film adds considerably to the
                    atmosphere. It was predominantly low-key, creating some
                    striking chiaroscuro effects, and brilliantly captures the
                    Messel interiors.The cinematographer was Otto Heller, whose
                    films included <em>The Ladykillers</em> (1955),
                    <em>Peeping Tom</em> (1960) and <em>Victim</em> (1961).
                    Heller used a series of wide-angle lenses to suggest space
                    and width where they did not exist, particularly in a key
                    ballroom scene, where camera trickery was used to deceive
                    the eye. The vertiginous high-angle shot of the young
                    Countessâs arrival at the palace of St Germain was created
                    because they could not afford to build the palace faÃ§ade.
                    Instead, they created the effect by putting up a corner of a
                    wall with a gargoyle on it, directing lights to give the
                    appearance of an open door and then shooting down onto the
                    carriage. Point-of-view shots were used constantly to
                    disguise the fact that many sets were either small or
                    half-built, or in some cases non-existent.

                  <p>
                    Dickinson often used shots of visual symbolism, common in
                    the silent film era and used by Alfred Hitchcock in almost
                    all of his films. One such key moment is when the Countess,
                    now armed with the secret of the cards, goes to the gambling
                    house. As she flings her crucifix onto a transparent glass
                    table so that it dominates the frame, Dickinson places the
                    camera underneath the table focusing not only on the
                    crucifix being used as a gambling tool, but the ceiling
                    above her head which depicts two huge claws that will now
                    symbolically consume her soul for the remainder of the film.

                    Mirrors are a recurring motif in the film: characters look
                    at themselves at crucial points and their actions are also
                    frequently seen reflected in mirrors. Such devices provide a
                    visual unity to the film which plays creatively off the
                    sets, the movement of the camera and angle of the
                    camerawork.

                    The scope of Messelâs design in the film is apparent from
                    the set and costume designs held in the V&amp;A collection.
                    Every prop and period detail had been researched
                    meticulously and parts of the set design had a twist. Scenes
                    in the palace of the old Countess had to look as if they had
                    remained unchanged for fifty years. The gilded, rococo
                    elaboration of her state apartments had to appear mellowed
                    under dust and patina; the vaulted hallway and great
                    staircases within her palace also had to strike a sombre
                    note. The squalor of the serfs had to be represented as did
                    many exteriors, including a bird market and a carriage
                    crossing a bridge, which were all filmed indoors.

                    When the film opened in June 1949, it received universal
                    praise from the critics. Dilys Powell wrote in The Sunday
                    Times:

                    A young Ken Adam was a production draughtsman on the film.
                    He would go on to design many of the James Bond films,
                    <em>Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang</em> (1968) and
                    <em>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and
                      Love the Bomb</em>

                    At the end of 1950 The Royal Opera House in London presented
                    its first ever production of Tchaikovskyâs
                    <em>The Queen of Spades</em>, directed by Michael Benthall.
                    As Messel had designed the film, he was the obvious choice
                    for the opera version. For the most significant scene, when
                    the Countess dies, Messel created a masterly conception: he
                    placed her in a giant armchair creating the illusion of her
                    shrunken image.

                    Messelâs last film was based on Tennessee Williamsâs stage
                    play <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em>. The film was directed
                    by Joseph L. Mankiewicz from a screenplay by Gore Vidal with
                    an all-star cast in the leading roles â Katharine Hepburn,
                    Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor. Filmed in Shepperton
                    Studios near London, Messelâs sub- tropical deep-south
                    jungle set for Mrs Venablesâ house, with its larger than
                    life exotic garden containing huge and menacing plants, was
                    reminiscent in style of his exterior stage settings for The
                    Little Hut, Ring Round the Moon and The House of Flowers.
                    The garden became the main set piece where many key scenes
                    take place, creating an essentially claustrophobic and
                    over-powering presence in the film.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Messelâs research into capturing the New Orleans French
                    Quarter atmosphere was as extensive as always. Images of
                    buildings, balconies, squares, gates, and, for the
                    extraordinary garden, photographs of prehistoric forests and
                    plants, are all contained in the V&amp;A collection.Messel
                    once again engaged Hugh Skillan to assist him on the film.
                    Skillan had worked with Messel since 1942; his headdresses
                    were so light and excellent in construction that artists
                    found them comfortable to wear. Skillan worked on making the
                    insect-eating plants and out-sized exotic foliage. Messel
                    made banana leaves with waxed crinkle paper and then mixed
                    them with real plants; he also made vines from paper twisted
                    round in coils and then covered with pale green flock. Over
                    seventy different varieties of plants were used on the set
                    and mixed with a painted backdrop; the effect was that of a
                    monstrous jungle.

                    In one scene which takes place in Sebastianâs studio, Messel
                    has placed masks from his 1920s reviews on the desk and on
                    the walls. Among the set designs for Suddenly, Last Summer
                    are more mundane sketches and ground plans for corridors,
                    offices for the hospital in which Elizabeth Taylorâs
                    character is being held and exteriors for the fictional
                    location, Cabeza de Lobo. The extraordinary baroque lift in
                    which Katharine Hepburn descends for her first entrance was
                    created with John Claridge, who assisted Messel on many
                    projects including the Dorchester Hotel suite created in
                    1953.

                    Winning Messel an Academy Award nomination for set and
                    costumes design, <em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em> would be his
                    last film. His successful working relationship with
                    Elizabeth Taylor led Twentieth Century Fox to commission him
                    to design her costumes and wigs for their forthcoming
                    mammoth production of <em>Cleopatra</em>, but this had an
                    unhappy end for Messel because his designs were never used
                    and he was replaced on the production by Irene Sharaff who
                    would win an Academy Award for her work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the mid-1960s, Messel moved to Barbados and began
                    designing homes there and for the adjacent island, Mustique
                    (including a villa for HRH The Princess Margaret). His work
                    as an architect would again reflect his inventive use of
                    materials: for his own house he made use of local coral
                    stone.

                    Messelâs creative ingenuity was evident throughout his
                    career in whatever medium he worked. For students of art,
                    design, performance and film, access to this unique
                    collection at the V&amp;A and the availability of his film
                    work on DVD gives new insight into the working practices and
                    techniques of one of Britainâs most talented and
                    accomplished stage designers.

                          At the beginning of 1939, Messel co-designed costumes
                          for the Alexander Korda epic
                          <em>The Thief of Baghdad</em> (the other two costume
                          designers on the film were John Armstrong and Marcel
                          Vertes). It was Britainâs first Technicolor film and
                          won Academy Awards for Special Effects, Art Direction
                          and Cinematography.
