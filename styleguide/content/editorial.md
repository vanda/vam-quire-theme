**Welcome to the launch issue of the V&A's annual Online Research Journal. Designed to complement the longstanding V&A Conservation Journal, this new initiative offers a lively forum for the discussion and publication of research undertaken in connection with all aspects of the Museum's activities.**

{% figure 'christopher-breward', 'is-pulled-left' %}

The contents are as diverse as the scope of the V&A's holdings and include in-depth articles on current research policy and practices, on the historical and archival work that underpins major Exhibition planning, and on the rich content of our archives. Focused object-in-context pieces present studies of particular collections and artefacts; and an interview with a maker explores the inspirational uses made of the Museum by artists and designers. I hope you'll agree that they all provide informative insights into the work of our curators, educators and fellows.

The benefits of an on-line format mean that we can incorporate feedback on individual pieces and suggestions for further articles and sections in a proactive and open manner. Inclusion is not restricted to V&A staff, and provided that submissions meet the standards set by our Editorial team and peer reviewers we welcome articles for future issues on the history of art, architecture and design relating to the V&A's collections, public programme or institutional history; features focusing on new acquisitions or objects linked to V&A exhibitions; reflections on the educational or creative industries role of the Museum and reviews and previews of V&A publications, conferences or displays. Further details on submission are available at [www.vam.ac.uk/vandajournal](www.vam.ac.uk/vandajournal) and we can be contacted at [vandajournal@vam.ac.uk](mailto:vandajournal@vam.ac.uk)
